## New Files Created

1. `/app/contracts/contracts/LinkDAOToken.sol` - Platform token contract
2. `/app/frontend/src/pages/admin.tsx` - Admin dashboard
3. `/app/frontend/src/pages/register.tsx` - User registration page
4. `/app/frontend/src/pages/social.tsx` - Social feed page
5. `/PHASE1_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Updated Files

1. `/app/contracts/scripts/deploy.ts` - Added token contract deployment
2. `/app/contracts/deployedAddresses.json` - Added token contract address
3. `/app/backend/.env` - Added token contract address
4. `/app/backend/src/index.ts` - Updated indexer service initialization
5. `/app/backend/src/services/indexerService.ts` - Added token contract ABI
6. `/app/frontend/.env.local` - Added admin address
7. `/app/frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx` - Added navigation links and admin access
8. `/app/frontend/src/pages/index.tsx` - Updated links to point to correct pages

## Implementation Notes

1. **Platform Token**: The LinkDAOToken contract is an ERC-20 token with additional governance features using OpenZeppelin contracts. It has a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens.

2. **Admin Dashboard**: The admin dashboard is accessible only to a specific wallet address (configured via environment variables) and shows system status and key metrics.

3. **User Registration**: New users can create profiles through the dedicated registration page, which interacts with the ProfileRegistry smart contract.

4. **Social Feed**: The social feed page allows users to view posts and create new ones (currently using mock data, but designed to integrate with backend services).

5. **Wallet Integration**: The wallet page displays balances and allows P2P transfers using the PaymentRouter smart contract.

## Next Steps

To move to Phase 2, the following enhancements are recommended:

1. Connect frontend components to actual backend APIs instead of using mock data
2. Implement real-time updates using WebSocket or similar technology
3. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
4. Implement proper authentication flow with JWT tokens
5. Add unit tests for frontend components and backend services
6. Conduct security audit of smart contracts
7. Implement IPFS integration for decentralized content storage

This completes the core infrastructure setup as outlined in Phase 1 of the product specification.
