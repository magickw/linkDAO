# Phase 2 Implementation Progress Summary

This document summarizes the progress made on implementing Phase 2 enhancements for the LinkDAO platform, focusing on connecting frontend components to actual backend APIs.

## Completed Implementations

### 1. Profile Management API Integration ✅

#### Services Created
- `/app/frontend/src/services/profileService.ts` - Complete service for all profile API endpoints
- Custom hooks in `/app/frontend/src/hooks/useProfile.ts`:
  - `useProfile(address)` - Fetch profile by address
  - `useCreateProfile()` - Create new profile
  - `useUpdateProfile()` - Update existing profile

#### Components Updated
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/profile.tsx` - Updated to use both backend API and smart contract interactions
  - Added dual data source support (backend first, fallback to contract)
  - Implemented proper error handling and loading states
  - Enhanced form submission to work with both backend and on-chain data

### 2. Social Feed API Integration ✅

#### Services Created
- `/app/frontend/src/services/postService.ts` - Complete service for all post API endpoints
- Custom hooks in `/app/frontend/src/hooks/usePosts.ts`:
  - `useFeed(forUser?)` - Get user feed
  - `useCreatePost()` - Create new post
  - `usePostsByAuthor(author)` - Get posts by author

#### Components Updated
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/social.tsx` - Updated to fetch real data from backend API
  - Added post creation functionality with backend integration
  - Implemented loading states and error handling
  - Maintained fallback to mock data if API is unavailable

### 3. Follow System API Integration ✅

#### Services Created
- `/app/frontend/src/services/followService.ts` - Complete service for all follow API endpoints

#### Custom Hooks Created
- `/app/frontend/src/hooks/useFollow.ts` with hooks for:
  - `useFollow()` - Follow/unfollow functionality
  - `useFollowStatus(follower, following)` - Check follow status
  - `useFollowers(address)` - Get followers
  - `useFollowing(address)` - Get following
  - `useFollowCount(address)` - Get follow counts

#### Components Created
- `/app/frontend/src/components/FollowButton.tsx` - Reusable follow button component

### 4. Environment Configuration ✅

#### Updated Files
- `/app/frontend/.env.local` - Added backend API URL configuration

### 5. Additional Components Implementation ✅

#### Components Created
- `/app/frontend/src/components/ProfileCard.tsx` - Profile card component
- `/app/frontend/src/components/ProfileList.tsx` - Profile list component
- `/app/frontend/src/components/PostCard.tsx` - Post card component
- `/app/frontend/src/components/FollowerList.tsx` - Follower list component
- `/app/frontend/src/components/FollowingList.tsx` - Following list component

#### Components Updated
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/social.tsx` - Enhanced with infinite scrolling and post cards
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/profile.tsx` - Enhanced with follower/following tabs and counts

### 6. Real-time Updates Implementation ✅

#### Backend Updates
- `/app/backend/src/index.ts` - Added WebSocket server with Socket.IO
- Installed `socket.io` and `@types/socket.io` dependencies

#### Frontend Services and Hooks
- `/app/frontend/src/services/webSocketService.ts` - WebSocket service
- `/app/frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` - Custom hook for WebSocket connections

#### Components Created
- `/app/frontend/src/components/NotificationSystem.tsx` - Notification system component
- Updated `/app/frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx` to include notification system

## Technical Architecture

### Service Layer
All services follow a consistent pattern:
- TypeScript interfaces matching backend models
- Proper error handling with descriptive messages
- Async/await implementation for clean code flow
- Environment variable configuration for API endpoints

### Hook Layer
Custom hooks provide:
- State management for loading, error, and success states
- Automatic data fetching based on dependencies
- Memoized callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Consistent return interfaces across all hooks

### Component Integration
Frontend components now:
- Use custom hooks for data fetching and mutations
- Display loading states during API operations
- Show error messages when API calls fail
- Maintain backward compatibility with mock data as fallback

## Next Steps

### 1. Complete Follow System Components
- [ ] Add follow suggestions component
- [ ] Implement follow notifications

### 2. Add Comprehensive Error Handling
- [ ] Create error boundary components
- [ ] Add toast notification system
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms for failed API calls
- [ ] Add user-friendly error messages

### 3. Implement Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for all service functions
- [ ] Write tests for all custom hooks
- [ ] Write tests for all new components
- [ ] Implement mock API responses for testing
- [ ] Implement integration tests for API interactions
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows

## Testing

### Unit Tests Needed
- [ ] Write tests for all service functions
- [ ] Write tests for all custom hooks
- [ ] Write tests for all new components
- [ ] Implement mock API responses for testing

### Integration Tests Needed
- [ ] Test API service integrations
- [ ] Test component interactions with hooks
- [ ] Test end-to-end user flows

## Success Criteria
