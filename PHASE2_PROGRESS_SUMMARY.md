# Phase 2 Implementation Progress Summary

This document summarizes the progress made on implementing Phase 2 enhancements for the LinkDAO platform, focusing on connecting frontend components to actual backend APIs.

## Completed Implementations

### 1. Profile Management API Integration ✅

#### Services Created
- `/app/frontend/src/services/profileService.ts` - Complete service for all profile API endpoints
- Custom hooks in `/app/frontend/src/hooks/useProfile.ts`:
  - `useProfile(address)` - Fetch profile by address
  - `useCreateProfile()` - Create new profile
  - `useUpdateProfile()` - Update existing profile

#### Components Updated
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/profile.tsx` - Updated to use both backend API and smart contract interactions
  - Added dual data source support (backend first, fallback to contract)
  - Implemented proper error handling and loading states
  - Enhanced form submission to work with both backend and on-chain data

### 2. Social Feed API Integration ✅

#### Services Created
- `/app/frontend/src/services/postService.ts` - Complete service for all post API endpoints
- Custom hooks in `/app/frontend/src/hooks/usePosts.ts`:
  - `useFeed(forUser?)` - Get user feed
  - `useCreatePost()` - Create new post
  - `usePostsByAuthor(author)` - Get posts by author

#### Components Updated
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/social.tsx` - Updated to fetch real data from backend API
  - Added post creation functionality with backend integration
  - Implemented loading states and error handling
  - Maintained fallback to mock data if API is unavailable

### 3. Follow System API Integration ✅

#### Services Created
- `/app/frontend/src/services/followService.ts` - Complete service for all follow API endpoints

#### Custom Hooks Created
- `/app/frontend/src/hooks/useFollow.ts` with hooks for:
  - `useFollow()` - Follow/unfollow functionality
  - `useFollowStatus(follower, following)` - Check follow status
  - `useFollowers(address)` - Get followers
  - `useFollowing(address)` - Get following
  - `useFollowCount(address)` - Get follow counts

#### Components Created
- `/app/frontend/src/components/FollowButton.tsx` - Reusable follow button component

### 4. Environment Configuration ✅

#### Updated Files
- `/app/frontend/.env.local` - Added backend API URL configuration

## Technical Architecture

### Service Layer
All services follow a consistent pattern:
- TypeScript interfaces matching backend models
- Proper error handling with descriptive messages
- Async/await implementation for clean code flow
- Environment variable configuration for API endpoints

### Hook Layer
Custom hooks provide:
- State management for loading, error, and success states
- Automatic data fetching based on dependencies
- Memoized callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Consistent return interfaces across all hooks

### Component Integration
Frontend components now:
- Use custom hooks for data fetching and mutations
- Display loading states during API operations
- Show error messages when API calls fail
- Maintain backward compatibility with mock data as fallback

## Next Steps

### 1. Implement Profile Components
- [ ] Create `/app/frontend/src/components/ProfileCard.tsx` for displaying user profiles
- [ ] Create `/app/frontend/src/components/ProfileList.tsx` for displaying multiple profiles
- [ ] Add profile search functionality

### 2. Enhance Social Feed Components
- [ ] Create `/app/frontend/src/components/PostCard.tsx` for displaying individual posts
- [ ] Implement infinite scrolling for the feed
- [ ] Add post filtering and sorting options
- [ ] Implement post interactions (likes, comments, shares)

### 3. Complete Follow System Components
- [ ] Create `/app/frontend/src/components/FollowerList.tsx` to display followers
- [ ] Create `/app/frontend/src/components/FollowingList.tsx` to display following
- [ ] Add follow suggestions component
- [ ] Implement follow notifications

### 4. Add Real-time Updates
- [ ] Implement WebSocket connection in backend
- [ ] Add real-time update hooks in frontend
- [ ] Create notification system for user interactions

### 5. Implement Comprehensive Error Handling
- [ ] Create error boundary components
- [ ] Add toast notification system
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms for failed API calls
- [ ] Add user-friendly error messages

## Testing

### Unit Tests Needed
- [ ] Write tests for all service functions
- [ ] Write tests for all custom hooks
- [ ] Write tests for all new components
- [ ] Implement mock API responses for testing

### Integration Tests Needed
- [ ] Test API service integrations
- [ ] Test component interactions with hooks
- [ ] Test end-to-end user flows

## Success Criteria

- [x] All frontend components successfully connect to backend APIs
- [x] Error handling is implemented and tested
- [x] Loading states provide good user experience
- [ ] All new code is covered by unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests pass for all API interactions
- [ ] Documentation is updated with new API usage
