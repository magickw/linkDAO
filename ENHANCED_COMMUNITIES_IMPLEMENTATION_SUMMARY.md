- Performance optimization for large datasets

## Styling Consistency

### Approach
- Unified Tailwind CSS implementation
- Consistent color palette based on Tailwind defaults
- Standardized spacing and typography
- Responsive design patterns
- Dark mode support

### Color Palette
- Primary: Blue (`blue-500`, `blue-600`)
- Secondary: Gray (`gray-100`, `gray-600`)
- Success: Green (`green-100`, `green-600`)
- Warning: Yellow (`yellow-100`, `yellow-600`)
- Danger: Red (`red-100`, `red-600`)

### Spacing
- xs: `px-2 py-1`
- sm: `px-3 py-2`
- md: `px-4 py-3`
- lg: `px-6 py-4`

## Loading State Enhancement

### CommunityCardSkeleton
- Content-structured skeleton matching actual card
- Proper animation timing
- Responsive design support
- Compact mode variant

### CommunityFeedSkeleton
- Multiple post skeletons
- Consistent styling with actual components
- Configurable post count
- Proper spacing and layout

## Accessibility Improvements

### ARIA Labels and Roles
- Proper ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Semantic HTML structure
- Role attributes for screen readers
- Descriptive labels for complex components

### Keyboard Navigation
- Tab navigation support
- Shortcut keys for common actions
- Focus management
- Escape key handling

### Focus Management
- Visible focus indicators
- Proper focus order
- Focus trapping for modals
- Restoration of focus after interactions

### Screen Reader Support
- Descriptive labels
- Live regions for dynamic content
- Proper heading structure
- Landmark roles

## Performance Enhancements

### Virtualization
- React-window implementation for large feeds
- Automatic switching based on item count
- Configurable height and item size
- Performance optimization for large datasets

### Memoization
- useMemo for expensive calculations
- useCallback for event handlers
- React.memo for component optimization
- Selective re-rendering

### Lazy Loading
- Code splitting for heavy components
- Dynamic imports
- Suspense boundaries
- Loading state management

## Testing

### Unit Tests
