- Implemented loading skeletons during prefetching

### Skeleton Loading
- Integrated skeleton loading components for both AI components
- Added loading states that show while data is being fetched
- Used existing LoadingSkeletons component for consistency

### Debouncing
- Added debouncing to input handlers in AIAssistedPostComposer
- Implemented 300ms debounce for content change events
- Used existing debounce utility from performanceOptimizations.ts

## Phase 3: Accessibility Improvements

### Keyboard Navigation
- Added comprehensive keyboard navigation support
- Implemented proper focus management with tab navigation
- Added keyboard event handlers for Enter and Space keys

### Screen Reader Support
- Added proper ARIA labels and roles to all interactive elements
- Implemented aria-busy states for loading indicators
- Added aria-expanded for collapsible panels
- Added descriptive aria-labels for icon-only buttons

### Touch Target Enhancement
- Integrated touchTargetClasses from useMobileOptimization hook
- Ensured all interactive elements meet WCAG AA touch target requirements
- Applied touch target classes to all buttons and interactive elements

## Phase 4: Security Enhancements

### Client-Side Validation
- Added comprehensive input validation to communityInteractionService
- Implemented length checks for titles, content, tags, and media URLs
- Added validation for number of tags and media URLs
- Added validation to AI-assisted functions with minimum content length requirements

### Rate Limiting
- Created new useRateLimit hook for client-side rate limiting
- Implemented specific rate limiters for different AI operations:
  - AI Post Generation: 5 requests per minute
  - AI Recommendations: 10 requests per minute
  - Community Join: 20 requests per minute
- Added error handling for rate limit exceeded scenarios

## Phase 5: Monitoring and Analytics

### Event Tracking
- Integrated analyticsService to track all AI component interactions
- Added tracking for component loads, AI function requests/successes/errors
- Added tracking for user interactions and rate limit events

### Error Boundaries
- Wrapped components with existing ErrorBoundary implementations
- Added ContentCreationErrorBoundary and CommunityErrorBoundary
- Implemented proper error fallback UIs

## Phase 6: User Experience Enhancements

### Mobile Optimization
- Integrated useMobileOptimization hook for responsive design
- Added compact layout for mobile devices
- Implemented touch-friendly controls and sizing

### Loading States
- Enhanced loading indicators with descriptive text
- Added specific loading states for different AI operations
- Implemented skeleton loading for initial component load
