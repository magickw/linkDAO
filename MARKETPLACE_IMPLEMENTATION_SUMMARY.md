# LinkDAO Marketplace Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the LinkDAO Marketplace feature, which allows users to buy and sell physical goods, digital assets, services, and NFTs using cryptocurrency payments directly through their integrated wallets.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Smart Contracts
- **Marketplace.sol**: Comprehensive smart contract with:
  - Fixed-price listings
  - Auction-style bidding
  - Escrow services with dispute resolution
  - Reputation-based trust scoring system
  - DAO-approved vendor functionality
  - Support for ETH and ERC-20 token payments
  - Reentrancy protection using OpenZeppelin contracts

### 2. Backend API
- **Marketplace Service**: In-memory storage implementation for listings, bids, escrows, and reputation
- **Marketplace Controller**: REST API endpoints for all marketplace operations
- **Marketplace Routes**: Express routes for marketplace functionality
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for protected endpoints

### 3. Frontend Components
- **Marketplace Page**: Main marketplace interface with tabs for browsing, my listings, and creating listings
- **ListingCard Component**: Reusable component for displaying marketplace listings
- **BidModal Component**: Modal for placing bids or buying items
- **EscrowPanel Component**: Component for managing escrow transactions
- **Marketplace Service**: Client-side service for interacting with backend API
