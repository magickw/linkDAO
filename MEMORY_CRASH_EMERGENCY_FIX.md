# ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY: Memory Crash Fix for Backend Deployment

## Critical Issue
Your backend is crashing with "JavaScript heap out of memory" error on Render. This is a production-critical issue that needs immediate attention.

## Root Cause
The Node.js process is exceeding the default memory limit (256MB) and crashing during startup or operation.

## Immediate Fixes

### 1. Increase Node.js Memory Limit
Add memory flags to your start script in package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node --max-old-space-size=1024 src/index.production.js"
  }
}
```

### 2. Optimize Production Index File
The current production file might be loading too much into memory at startup.

### 3. Add Memory Monitoring
Implement memory usage monitoring to prevent future crashes.

### 4. Render Configuration
Configure Render to use a higher memory plan if needed.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Update package.json** - Add memory flags
2. **Optimize startup** - Reduce initial memory footprint  
3. **Add monitoring** - Track memory usage
4. **Deploy fix** - Push changes to Render

## Expected Results
- âœ… Backend starts successfully
- âœ… No more memory crashes
- âœ… Stable production deployment
- âœ… Memory usage monitoring

This is a critical production issue that needs immediate resolution.
