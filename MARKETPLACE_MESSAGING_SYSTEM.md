## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Enhancements

  ADD COLUMN product_id uuid REFERENCES products(id),
  ADD COLUMN listing_id integer REFERENCES listings(id),
  ADD COLUMN context_metadata jsonb DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
  ADD COLUMN is_automated boolean DEFAULT false;
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**

   - Moderators can join dispute conversations
   - System messages are clearly marked

2. **Data Privacy**
   - Order details are embedded in context metadata
   - Messages are end-to-end encrypted
   - Analytics data is aggregated and anonymized

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Messaging rate limits prevent spam
   - Template creation is rate-limited
   - Quick reply suggestions are cached

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Indexes**
   - Indexes on order_id, product_id, and conversation_type
   - Composite indexes for common query patterns

2. **Caching**
   - Conversation metadata caching
   - Template caching for quick replies
   - Analytics data pre-computation

3. **Background Processing**
   - Asynchronous conversation creation
   - Batch analytics updates
   - Deferred template usage tracking

## Future Enhancements
