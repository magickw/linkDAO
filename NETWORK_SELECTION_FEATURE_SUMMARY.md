# Network Selection Feature Summary

## Current Implementation

The checkout flow already supports network selection for payments, including Polygon. Here's how it works:

### 1. Network Switcher Component
- Located at `src/components/Web3/NetworkSwitcher.tsx`
- Supports multiple networks including:
  - Ethereum (Mainnet)
  - Polygon
  - Arbitrum
  - Base
  - Sepolia Testnet
  - Base Sepolia Testnet

### 2. Integration in Checkout Flow
- NetworkSwitcher is integrated in the checkout header (visible on medium screens and larger)
- Users can switch networks before selecting a payment method
- Payment methods are automatically filtered based on the selected network

### 3. Payment Method Availability by Network
- **USDC** is available on all supported networks:
  - Ethereum (Chain ID: 1)
  - Polygon (Chain ID: 137)
  - Arbitrum (Chain ID: 42161)
  - Base (Chain ID: 8453)
  - Sepolia (Chain ID: 11155111)
  - Base Sepolia (Chain ID: 84532)

- **USDT** is available on:
  - Ethereum (Chain ID: 1)
  - Polygon (Chain ID: 137)

### 4. User Experience
1. User navigates to checkout
2. User can see their current network in the header
3. User clicks the network switcher to view available networks
4. User selects Polygon (or another network)
5. Wallet automatically switches to the selected network
6. Payment methods are updated to show only options available on the selected network
7. User selects a payment method (USDC/USDT on Polygon)
8. User proceeds with checkout using the selected network and payment method

## Verification

The implementation ensures that:
- Users can easily switch between supported networks
- Payment methods are automatically filtered by network
- Network information is clearly displayed throughout the checkout process
- Users can make payments using stablecoins on Polygon or other supported networks

## Testing

To verify this functionality:
1. Navigate to the checkout flow
2. Look for the network switcher in the header (compact version)
3. Click the network switcher to see available networks
4. Select Polygon
5. Confirm that payment methods update to show Polygon-specific options
6. Select a Polygon payment method (USDC or USDT)
7. Proceed with checkout to confirm the network is correctly used
