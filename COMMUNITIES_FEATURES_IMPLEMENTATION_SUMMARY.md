# Communities Features Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the previously stubbed communities features in the LinkDAO platform.

## Overview

The communities feature implementation has been enhanced to include complete functionality for governance, moderation, and community management. All previously stubbed features have now been fully implemented with proper database schemas, business logic, and audit trails.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Governance System (COMPLETE)

#### New Database Tables
- `community_governance_proposals` - Stores governance proposals for communities
- `community_governance_votes` - Records votes on governance proposals

#### Key Features
- **Proposal Creation**: Community members can create governance proposals with titles, descriptions, and types
- **Voting System**: Members can vote on proposals with yes/no/abstain options
- **Voting Power**: Voting power is based on member reputation
- **Proposal Lifecycle**: Proposals progress through pending → active → passed/rejected → executed/expired states
- **Quorum System**: Proposals require a minimum number of votes to become active
- **Majority Requirements**: Configurable percentage needed for proposal approval

#### API Methods
- `getGovernanceProposals()` - Retrieve proposals with filtering and pagination
- `createGovernanceProposal()` - Create new governance proposals
- `voteOnProposal()` - Vote on active proposals

### 2. Moderation Actions (COMPLETE)

#### New Database Table
- `community_moderation_actions` - Audit trail for all moderation actions

#### Key Features
- **Content Approval/Rejection**: Moderators can approve or reject posts
- **User Management**: Ban/unban users from communities
- **Role Management**: Promote/demote users to/from moderator roles
- **Permission System**: Only admins and moderators can perform actions
- **Audit Trail**: All actions are recorded with timestamps and reasons

#### API Method
- `moderateContent()` - Perform moderation actions with full audit trail

### 3. Community Update (COMPLETE)

#### Key Features
- **Permission Checking**: Only admins and moderators can update communities
- **Field Validation**: Proper validation of all update fields
- **Partial Updates**: Support for updating individual fields
- **Audit Trail**: Changes are timestamped

#### API Method
- `updateCommunity()` - Update community details with proper permissions

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes

Added three new tables to support the enhanced communities features:

1. **community_governance_proposals**
   - Tracks all governance proposals within communities
   - Includes voting periods, status tracking, and vote counts
   - References communities table with cascade delete

2. **community_governance_votes**
   - Records individual votes on proposals
   - Stores voting power and choices
   - Composite primary key on proposalId and voterAddress to prevent duplicate votes

3. **community_moderation_actions**
   - Maintains audit trail of all moderation actions
   - Records who performed what action on what target
   - Includes reasons and metadata for each action

### Service Layer Enhancements

The `CommunityService` class has been enhanced with:

1. **Full Governance Implementation**
   - Proposal creation with validation
   - Voting system with power calculation
   - Status management and quorum checking

2. **Complete Moderation System**
   - Role-based access control
   - User and content moderation actions
   - Comprehensive audit trail

3. **Robust Update Mechanism**
   - Permission validation
   - Field-level updates
   - Error handling

## API Endpoints

All functionality is accessible through the existing community service layer and can be exposed via API endpoints:

- `GET /api/communities/:id/governance` - List governance proposals
- `POST /api/communities/:id/governance` - Create new proposal
- `POST /api/communities/:id/governance/:proposalId/vote` - Vote on proposal
- `POST /api/communities/:id/moderate` - Perform moderation actions
- `PUT /api/communities/:id` - Update community details

## Security Considerations

- All actions require proper authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control for moderation and governance actions
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit trails for accountability
- Protection against duplicate votes

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:
- Token-weighted voting in addition to reputation-based voting
- Advanced proposal types with executable code
- Automated proposal execution
- Delegated voting system
- Enhanced moderation tools with AI assistance
