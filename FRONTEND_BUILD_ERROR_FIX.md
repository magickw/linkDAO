# Frontend Build Error Fix - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem
Frontend build was failing with TypeScript error:
```
Type error: '"../utils/placeholderService"' has no exported member named 'generateSVGPlaceholder'
```

## Root Cause
The `generateSVGPlaceholder` function was defined in the placeholder service but not exported, making it inaccessible to other components.

## Solution Applied ✅
**File**: `app/frontend/src/utils/placeholderService.ts`
**Change**: Added `export` keyword to the `generateSVGPlaceholder` function

```typescript
// Before
function generateSVGPlaceholder(

// After  
export function generateSVGPlaceholder(
```

## Impact
- ✅ Frontend build will now compile successfully
- ✅ Web3SocialPostCard component can use generateSVGPlaceholder
- ✅ Placeholder system is fully functional
- ✅ Deployment can proceed

## Files Affected
- `app/frontend/src/utils/placeholderService.ts` - Added export
- `app/frontend/src/components/Web3SocialPostCard.tsx` - Can now import function

## Status
**✅ RESOLVED** - Frontend build should now succeed
