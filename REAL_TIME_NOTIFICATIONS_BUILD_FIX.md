# Real-time Notifications Build Fix Summary

## Issue
TypeScript compilation error during Vercel build:
```
Type error: An interface can only extend an object type or intersection of object types with statically known members.
```

## Root Cause
The `ToastNotification` interface was trying to extend `RealTimeNotification`, which is a union type. TypeScript doesn't allow interfaces to extend union types directly.

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed Interface Definition**: Changed `ToastNotification` from extending the union type to explicitly defining all required properties
2. **Updated Type Conversion**: Modified the `addNotification` function to properly map all properties from `RealTimeNotification` to `ToastNotification`
3. **Improved Exports**: Updated the index file to use proper type exports

## Files Modified
- `app/frontend/src/components/RealTimeNotifications/ImmediateNotificationSystem.tsx`
- `app/frontend/src/components/RealTimeNotifications/index.ts`

## Changes Made

### Before (Problematic):
```typescript
interface ToastNotification extends RealTimeNotification {
  id: string;
  isVisible: boolean;
  isExiting: boolean;
  showTime: number;
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
interface ToastNotification {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  category: NotificationCategory;
  priority: NotificationPriority;
  urgency: NotificationUrgency;
  title: string;
  message: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  read: boolean;
  dismissed: boolean;
  actionUrl?: string;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
  expiresAt?: Date;
  isVisible: boolean;
  isExiting: boolean;
  showTime: number;
}
```

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - TypeScript compilation error fixed. The real-time notification system should now build successfully on Vercel.

## Next Steps
- Monitor the next deployment to ensure the build completes successfully
- All notification system functionality remains intact with proper type safety
