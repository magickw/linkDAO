# Dashboard Widget Build Fix Summary

## Issue Description
During the Vercel deployment build process, the following TypeScript error was encountered:

```
./src/components/Admin/Dashboard/DashboardWidget.tsx:2:10
Type error: Module '"../../../stores/adminDashboardStore"' declares 'LayoutConfig' locally, but it is not exported.
```

## Root Cause
The [LayoutConfig](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/frontend/src/stores/adminDashboardStore.ts#L5-L12) interface was defined in [adminDashboardStore.ts](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/frontend/src/stores/adminDashboardStore.ts) but was not exported, making it inaccessible to other modules that needed to import it.

## Changes Made

### Fixed Export Issue
Updated [/src/stores/adminDashboardStore.ts](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/frontend/src/stores/adminDashboardStore.ts) to export the [LayoutConfig](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/frontend/src/stores/adminDashboardStore.ts#L5-L12) interface:

```typescript
// Before
interface LayoutConfig {
  // ... interface definition
}

// After
export interface LayoutConfig {
  // ... interface definition
}
```

## Verification
The fix has been applied and should resolve the TypeScript compilation error that was preventing the build from completing successfully.

## Additional Notes
This is a common TypeScript issue where interfaces need to be explicitly exported to be accessible from other modules. The fix ensures proper type safety while allowing the DashboardWidget component to import and use the LayoutConfig interface as intended.
