# Smart Contract Implementation Design

## Overview

This design document outlines the architecture and implementation strategy for deploying a comprehensive smart contract ecosystem consisting of 16 interconnected contracts. The system provides governance, marketplace functionality, NFT trading, reputation management, and social features for a Web3 platform.

    uint256 stakingStartTime;
    uint256 lockPeriod;
    uint256 rewardRate;
    uint256 lastRewardClaim;
    bool isActive;
}

// Marketplace
struct Listing {
    uint256 id;
    address seller;
    address tokenAddress;
    uint256 price;
    uint256 quantity;
    ItemType itemType;
    ListingType listingType;
    ListingStatus status;
    // ... additional fields
}

// EnhancedEscrow
struct Escrow {
    uint256 id;
    uint256 listingId;
    address buyer;
    address seller;
    uint256 amount;
    EscrowStatus status;
    // ... additional fields
}

// ReputationSystem
struct ReputationScore {
    uint256 totalPoints;
    uint256 reviewCount;
    uint256 averageRating;
    uint256 weightedScore;
    ReputationTier tier;
    // ... additional fields
}
```

### State Management

- **Storage Optimization**: Use packed structs and efficient data types
- **Gas Efficiency**: Implement batch operations for multiple updates
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive event emission for off-chain indexing
- **Access Patterns**: Optimize for common read/write operations

## Error Handling

### Security Measures

1. **Reentrancy Protection**: All external calls protected with ReentrancyGuard
2. **Access Control**: Role-based permissions using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl
3. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation
4. **Overflow Protection**: Use of SafeMath or Solidity 0.8+ built-in protection
5. **Emergency Mechanisms**: Pause functionality for critical contracts

### Error Recovery

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Contracts continue operating even if dependencies fail
2. **Rollback Mechanisms**: Ability to revert state changes in case of errors
3. **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic suspension of operations under abnormal conditions
4. **Manual Overrides**: Administrative functions for emergency interventions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- **Contract-Level Tests**: Individual contract functionality
- **Function-Level Tests**: Each public function tested independently
- **Edge Case Testing**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Gas Usage Testing**: Optimization verification

### Integration Testing

- **Cross-Contract Interactions**: Multi-contract workflows
- **End-to-End Scenarios**: Complete user journeys
- **Upgrade Testing**: Proxy upgrade scenarios
- **Performance Testing**: High-load scenarios

### Security Testing

- **Static Analysis**: Slither, MythX, and other tools
- **Formal Verification**: Critical functions mathematically proven
- **Penetration Testing**: Simulated attacks
- **Audit Preparation**: Code review and documentation

### Test Coverage Requirements

- 100% branch coverage for critical paths
- All public functions tested
- All error conditions tested

## Deployment Strategy

### Network Configuration

**Testnet Deployment:**
- Sepolia for Ethereum testing

## Gas Optimization

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Storage Packing**: Efficient struct packing to minimize storage slots
2. **Batch Operations**: Multiple operations in single transaction
3. **Event Optimization**: Indexed parameters for efficient filtering
4. **Function Modifiers**: Reusable validation logic
5. **Library Usage**: Shared code through libraries

### Gas Estimates

- Token transfers: ~50,000 gas
- Marketplace listings: ~150,000 gas
- Escrow creation: ~200,000 gas
- Governance voting: ~100,000 gas
- NFT minting: ~180,000 gas

## Security Considerations

### Access Control Matrix

| Contract | Admin Functions | User Functions | Moderator Functions |
|----------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| LDAOToken | Mint, Burn | Stake, Transfer | None |
| Governance | Parameters | Vote, Propose | None |
| Marketplace | Fees, Pause | List, Buy | Verify |
| Escrow | Emergency | Create, Approve | Resolve |
| Reputation | Suspend | Review, Vote | Verify |

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Multi-signature Requirements**: Critical operations require multiple signatures
2. **Time Delays**: Important changes have mandatory waiting periods
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam and abuse
4. **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic shutdown under attack
5. **Upgrade Governance**: Community-controlled upgrades

## Integration Points
