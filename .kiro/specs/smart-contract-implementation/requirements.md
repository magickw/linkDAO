# Smart Contract Implementation Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing and deploying a comprehensive smart contract ecosystem for the Web3 marketplace platform. The system includes 16 smart contracts covering governance, marketplace functionality, NFT trading, reputation systems, and social features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Infrastructure Contracts

5. WHEN deploying the core infrastructure THEN the system SHALL ensure all contracts are properly linked and configured

### Requirement 2: Marketplace and Trading Contracts

**User Story:** As a marketplace user, I want to buy and sell items through secure smart contracts, so that I can trade with confidence and proper escrow protection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying marketplace contracts THEN the system SHALL deploy Marketplace contract with multi-asset support
2. WHEN deploying marketplace contracts THEN the system SHALL deploy EnhancedEscrow contract with automated release mechanisms
3. WHEN deploying marketplace contracts THEN the system SHALL deploy DisputeResolution contract with community arbitration
4. WHEN deploying marketplace contracts THEN the system SHALL deploy PaymentRouter contract for multi-token payments
5. WHEN deploying marketplace contracts THEN the system SHALL ensure proper integration between all trading contracts

### Requirement 3: NFT Ecosystem Contracts

**User Story:** As an NFT creator and trader, I want to mint, trade, and manage NFT collections through dedicated smart contracts, so that I can participate in the NFT marketplace with full functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying NFT contracts THEN the system SHALL deploy NFTMarketplace contract with minting and trading capabilities
2. WHEN deploying NFT contracts THEN the system SHALL deploy NFTCollectionFactory contract for creating custom collections
3. WHEN deploying NFT contracts THEN the system SHALL ensure royalty distribution mechanisms are properly implemented
4. WHEN deploying NFT contracts THEN the system SHALL support both ERC721 and ERC1155 standards
5. WHEN deploying NFT contracts THEN the system SHALL integrate with the main marketplace for cross-platform trading

### Requirement 4: Social and Community Contracts

**User Story:** As a community member, I want to interact with social features through smart contracts, so that I can tip creators, follow users, and participate in community governance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying social contracts THEN the system SHALL deploy TipRouter contract for creator tipping
2. WHEN deploying social contracts THEN the system SHALL deploy FollowModule contract for social connections
3. WHEN deploying social contracts THEN the system SHALL deploy RewardPool contract for community incentives
4. WHEN deploying social contracts THEN the system SHALL ensure proper token flow between social features
5. WHEN deploying social contracts THEN the system SHALL integrate with reputation system for social scoring

### Requirement 5: Contract Deployment and Configuration

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to deploy all contracts in the correct order with proper configuration, so that the entire ecosystem functions cohesively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the contract ecosystem THEN the system SHALL follow the correct deployment sequence
2. WHEN deploying the contract ecosystem THEN the system SHALL configure all contract addresses and dependencies
3. WHEN deploying the contract ecosystem THEN the system SHALL set appropriate initial parameters and permissions
4. WHEN deploying the contract ecosystem THEN the system SHALL verify all contract interactions work correctly
5. WHEN deploying the contract ecosystem THEN the system SHALL provide deployment documentation and addresses

### Requirement 6: Testing and Verification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for all smart contracts, so that I can ensure the system is secure and functions as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing smart contracts THEN the system SHALL provide unit tests for all contract functions
2. WHEN testing smart contracts THEN the system SHALL provide integration tests for contract interactions
3. WHEN testing smart contracts THEN the system SHALL provide security tests for common vulnerabilities
4. WHEN testing smart contracts THEN the system SHALL achieve minimum 90% test coverage
5. WHEN testing smart contracts THEN the system SHALL pass all security audits and static analysis

### Requirement 7: Gas Optimization and Efficiency

**User Story:** As a user, I want smart contract interactions to be gas-efficient, so that I can use the platform without excessive transaction costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizing contracts THEN the system SHALL minimize gas costs for common operations
2. WHEN optimizing contracts THEN the system SHALL implement batch operations where appropriate
3. WHEN optimizing contracts THEN the system SHALL use efficient data structures and storage patterns
4. WHEN optimizing contracts THEN the system SHALL provide gas estimates for all major functions
5. WHEN optimizing contracts THEN the system SHALL document gas costs and optimization strategies

### Requirement 8: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a platform stakeholder, I want robust security measures in all smart contracts, so that user funds and data are protected from malicious actors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing security THEN the system SHALL use OpenZeppelin security patterns and libraries
2. WHEN implementing security THEN the system SHALL implement proper access control for administrative functions
3. WHEN implementing security THEN the system SHALL protect against reentrancy attacks
4. WHEN implementing security THEN the system SHALL implement emergency pause mechanisms where appropriate
5. WHEN implementing security THEN the system SHALL follow security best practices for all contract interactions

### Requirement 9: Upgradeability and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want the ability to upgrade contracts safely, so that I can fix bugs and add features without disrupting the ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing upgradeability THEN the system SHALL use proxy patterns for upgradeable contracts
2. WHEN implementing upgradeability THEN the system SHALL implement proper governance for upgrade decisions
3. WHEN implementing upgradeability THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity during upgrades
4. WHEN implementing upgradeability THEN the system SHALL provide rollback mechanisms for failed upgrades
5. WHEN implementing upgradeability THEN the system SHALL document upgrade procedures and risks

### Requirement 10: Documentation and Integration
