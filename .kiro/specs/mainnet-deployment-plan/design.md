# LinkDAO Mainnet Deployment Plan - Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the comprehensive architecture and implementation strategy for deploying the LinkDAO smart contract ecosystem to Ethereum mainnet. The deployment encompasses a production-ready Web3 social platform with governance, marketplace, reputation, and DeFi features, built on a foundation of 7 core smart contracts with extensive monitoring and emergency response capabilities.

    treasury: string;
    emergency: string;
    governance: string;
  };
  verification: {
    etherscan: boolean;
    apiKey: string;
  };
}
```

### 3. Smart Contract Layer

#### Foundation Contracts

- **DisputeResolution**: Community arbitration with escalation paths

#### Extended Feature Contracts
- **NFTMarketplace**: ERC721/ERC1155 trading platform
- **PaymentRouter**: Multi-token payment processing
- **RewardPool**: Staking rewards and incentive distribution

### 4. Monitoring and Observability Layer

#### Contract Health Monitoring (362-line system)
```typescript
interface MonitoringMetrics {
  contractHealth: {
    balances: Record<string, string>;
    transactionCounts: Record<string, number>;
    lastActivity: Record<string, number>;
    status: 'healthy' | 'warning' | 'critical';
  };
  gasMetrics: {
    currentPrice: string;
    alertThresholds: {
      normal: string;
      high: string;
      critical: string;
    };
  };
  alerting: {
    slack: string;
    discord: string;
    email: string[];
  };
}
```

#### Real-Time Alerting System
- **Multi-Channel Notifications**: Slack, Discord, Email integration
- **Severity-Based Alerts**: Info, Warning, Critical classifications
- **Automated Response**: Circuit breakers and emergency procedures
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Web-based real-time status display

### 5. Emergency Response System

#### Emergency Procedures (508-line system)
```typescript
interface EmergencyActions {
  pause: {
    contracts: string[];
    confirmations: number;
    executionTime: number;
  };
  withdraw: {
    sources: string[];
    destination: string;
    amounts: Record<string, string>;
  };
  ownership: {
    contracts: string[];
    newOwner: string;
    multisigRequired: boolean;
  };
}
```

#### Incident Response Procedures
1. **Contract Exploit Response**: Automated pause and fund protection
2. **High Gas Price Attack**: Manual intervention with rate limiting
3. **Governance Attack**: Emergency governance override
4. **Oracle Manipulation**: Automated price feed validation
5. **Network Congestion**: Dynamic gas price adjustment

## Data Models

### Deployment State Management
```typescript
interface DeploymentState {
  phase: 'pre-deployment' | 'deploying' | 'post-deployment' | 'operational';
  contracts: {
    [contractName: string]: {
      address: string;
      deploymentTx: string;
      verified: boolean;
      owner: string;
      status: 'deployed' | 'configured' | 'active';
    };
  };
  configuration: {
    networkId: number;
    gasUsed: string;
    totalCost: string;
    deploymentTime: number;
  };
  monitoring: {
    enabled: boolean;
    lastCheck: number;
    alertsActive: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Treasury Configuration
```typescript
interface TreasuryConfig {
  multisig: {
    address: string;
    signers: string[];
    threshold: number;
  };
  tokenomics: {
    totalSupply: string;
    initialDistribution: {
      treasury: string;
      team: string;
      community: string;
      liquidity: string;
    };
  };
  staking: {
    tiers: Array<{
      duration: number;
      apr: number;
      minAmount: string;
    }>;
  };
}
```

## Error Handling

### Deployment Error Recovery
- **Transaction Failure**: Automatic retry with increased gas
- **Network Issues**: Fallback to alternative RPC endpoints
- **Verification Failure**: Manual verification with backup API keys
- **Configuration Errors**: Rollback to previous stable state

### Runtime Error Management
- **Contract Pausing**: Automated pause on critical errors
- **Fund Recovery**: Emergency withdrawal procedures
- **Governance Override**: Emergency proposal fast-tracking
- **Communication**: Automated stakeholder notifications
