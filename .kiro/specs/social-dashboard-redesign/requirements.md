# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing web3 social platform into a modern, user-friendly interface that combines the best aspects of Facebook-style social feeds and Reddit-style community discussions. The redesign focuses on creating an integrated dashboard experience where authenticated users can seamlessly interact with their social network, consume content from their followings, and participate in community discussions.

The current platform has separate pages for different functionalities, but this redesign consolidates the core social experience into a unified dashboard while maintaining the web3 authentication and blockchain integration features.
