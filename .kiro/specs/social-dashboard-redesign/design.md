# Design Document

## Overview

This design transforms the existing web3 social platform into a unified, Facebook-style dashboard that integrates personal feeds, community discussions, and web3 functionality. The redesign consolidates the current separate pages (dashboard, social, communities) into a cohesive experience while maintaining all existing web3 features and adding Reddit-style community functionality.

The design leverages the existing component architecture and extends it with new layouts, navigation patterns, and community features. The goal is to create an intuitive, modern social platform that feels familiar to users of traditional social media while providing advanced web3 capabilities.

### State Management

The application will use React Context and hooks for state management:

- **Web3Context**: Wallet connection, user authentication
- **FeedContext**: Personal feed data, post interactions
- **CommunityContext**: Community data, memberships, discussions
- **UIContext**: Layout state, active views, modals

}
```

## Data Models

### Enhanced Community Model

```typescript
interface Community {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  displayName: string;
  description: string;
  rules: string[];
  memberCount: number;
  createdAt: Date;
  avatar?: string;
  banner?: string;
  category: string;
  tags: string[];
  isPublic: boolean;
  moderators: string[];
  treasuryAddress?: string;
  governanceToken?: string;
  settings: CommunitySettings;
}

interface CommunitySettings {
  allowedPostTypes: PostType[];
  requireApproval: boolean;
  minimumReputation: number;
  stakingRequirements: StakingRequirement[];
}

interface CommunityMembership {
  userId: string;
  communityId: string;
  role: 'member' | 'moderator' | 'admin';
  joinedAt: Date;
  reputation: number;
  contributions: number;
}
```

### Enhanced Post Model

```typescript
interface CommunityPost extends Post {
  communityId: string;
  flair?: string;
  isPinned: boolean;
  isLocked: boolean;
  upvotes: number;
  downvotes: number;
  comments: Comment[];
  parentId?: string; // For threaded discussions
}

interface Comment {
  id: string;
  postId: string;
  parentId?: string;
  author: string;
  content: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  upvotes: number;
  downvotes: number;
  replies: Comment[];
  depth: number;
}
```

### Navigation State Model

```typescript
interface NavigationState {
  activeView: 'feed' | 'community';
  activeCommunity?: string;
  sidebarCollapsed: boolean;
  rightSidebarVisible: boolean;
  modalState: {
    postCreation: boolean;
    communityJoin: boolean;
    userProfile: boolean;
  };
}
```

## Error Handling

### Error Boundaries

- **FeedErrorBoundary**: Handles errors in feed loading and post interactions
- **CommunityErrorBoundary**: Handles community-specific errors
- **Web3ErrorBoundary**: Handles wallet and blockchain interaction errors

### Error States

1. **Network Errors**: Graceful degradation with offline indicators
2. **Authentication Errors**: Clear prompts to reconnect wallet
3. **Community Access Errors**: Appropriate messaging for private communities
4. **Transaction Errors**: Detailed error messages for failed web3 transactions

### Fallback Mechanisms

- **Cached Data**: Show cached content when network is unavailable
- **Mock Data**: Development fallbacks for testing
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without web3 features

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- **Component Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library for all new components
- **Hook Testing**: Custom hooks for community management and navigation
- **Utility Testing**: Helper functions for data formatting and validation

### Integration Testing

- **Feed Integration**: Test feed loading, post creation, and interactions
- **Community Integration**: Test community joining, posting, and moderation
- **Web3 Integration**: Test wallet connections and blockchain interactions

### E2E Testing

- **User Flows**: Complete user journeys from login to posting
- **Cross-Platform**: Mobile and desktop responsive behavior
- **Performance**: Load testing with large feeds and communities

### Accessibility Testing

- **Screen Reader**: Full navigation and interaction support
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete keyboard accessibility
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling in modals and navigation

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Virtual Scrolling**: For large feeds and comment threads
2. **Image Lazy Loading**: Progressive loading of media content
3. **Code Splitting**: Route-based and component-based splitting
4. **Caching**: Intelligent caching of user data and community information

### Bundle Optimization

- **Tree Shaking**: Remove unused code from web3 libraries

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam and abuse

### Data Protection

- **Input Sanitization**: Prevent XSS attacks in user content
- **Content Validation**: Validate all user inputs and uploads
- **Privacy Controls**: User control over data sharing and visibility

### Web3 Security

- **Transaction Validation**: Verify all blockchain transactions
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Secure interaction with deployed contracts
- **Wallet Security**: Best practices for wallet connection and signing
