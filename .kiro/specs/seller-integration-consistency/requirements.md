# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current seller implementation has comprehensive functionality across onboarding, profile management, dashboard, and store pages, but suffers from critical integration inconsistencies and data synchronization issues. This feature addresses API endpoint standardization, data type consistency, cache management, error handling uniformity, and enhanced mobile optimization to create a cohesive seller experience across all components.

## Glossary

- **Seller System**: The complete set of components including SellerOnboarding, SellerProfilePage, SellerDashboard, and SellerStorePage
- **API Endpoint Pattern**: Consistent URL structure for all seller-related API calls
- **Data Synchronization**: Real-time consistency of seller data across all components
- **Cache Invalidation**: Process of clearing outdated cached data when seller information changes
- **Tier System**: Seller performance-based classification system with associated benefits and limitations

6. THE Seller System SHALL provide fallback mechanisms when cache invalidation fails

### Requirement 4: Unified Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As a seller, I want consistent error handling and user feedback across all seller components, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it regardless of which part of the system I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Seller System SHALL implement consistent error handling strategies across all seller components
2. WHEN errors occur THE Seller System SHALL provide graceful degradation with fallback data where appropriate
3. THE Seller System SHALL display consistent user feedback mechanisms across all seller interfaces
4. WHEN components encounter errors THE Seller System SHALL use error boundaries to prevent crashes
5. THE Seller System SHALL provide helpful error messages that guide sellers toward resolution
6. WHEN errors are recoverable THE Seller System SHALL offer retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

### Requirement 5: Standardized Image Upload and Management

**User Story:** As a seller, I want consistent image handling across all seller components, so that my images are processed and displayed uniformly throughout the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Seller System SHALL use a unified image upload pipeline across all seller components
2. WHEN images are uploaded THE Seller System SHALL process them using consistent optimization and storage methods
3. THE Seller System SHALL eliminate inconsistencies between base64 encoding and CDN URL handling
4. WHEN image processing fails THE Seller System SHALL provide consistent fallback handling across all components
5. THE Seller System SHALL implement proper image optimization for different display contexts
6. THE Seller System SHALL ensure image URLs remain stable and accessible across all seller interfaces

### Requirement 6: Integrated Seller Tier System

**User Story:** As a seller, I want the tier system to be fully integrated across all seller components, so that I understand my current tier benefits and limitations and can work toward tier upgrades.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Seller System SHALL display tier information consistently across all seller components
2. WHEN seller tier changes THE Seller System SHALL immediately update tier-based feature availability
3. THE Seller System SHALL implement tier-based feature gating that works across all seller interfaces
4. WHEN sellers view tier information THE Seller System SHALL show clear tier benefits and upgrade paths
5. THE Seller System SHALL provide tier upgrade workflows that are accessible from all seller components
6. THE Seller System SHALL enforce tier-based limitations consistently across the entire seller experience

### Requirement 7: Enhanced Mobile Optimization

**User Story:** As a seller using mobile devices, I want all seller components to be fully optimized for mobile use, so that I can manage my seller activities effectively from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Seller System SHALL provide responsive design that works effectively on all mobile devices
2. WHEN sellers use mobile devices THE Seller System SHALL optimize navigation for touch interactions

4. WHEN forms are displayed on mobile THE Seller System SHALL optimize input methods for touch devices
5. THE Seller System SHALL provide swipe gestures and mobile-friendly interactions where appropriate
6. THE Seller System SHALL ensure all seller functionality is accessible and usable on mobile devices

### Requirement 8: Real-time Features and Live Updates

**User Story:** As a seller, I want real-time updates for notifications, order status changes, and activity feeds, so that I can respond quickly to important seller events.

#### Acceptance Criteria
