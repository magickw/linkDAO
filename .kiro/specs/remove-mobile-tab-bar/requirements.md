# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature removes the crowded mobile bottom tab bar navigation since the application already has a functional burger menu in the header. The bottom tab bar creates a cluttered mobile experience with too many navigation options competing for limited screen space.

## Glossary

- **Mobile Tab Bar**: The fixed bottom navigation component that displays multiple tabs (Home, Communities, Messages, Governance, Marketplace, Settings) on mobile devices
- **Burger Menu**: The hamburger menu icon in the mobile header that expands to show navigation options
- **Layout Component**: The main layout wrapper component that renders both navigation systems
- **MobileNavigation Component**: The React component that renders the bottom tab bar

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want a cleaner mobile interface without the crowded bottom tab bar, so that I have more screen space and a less cluttered experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the application on mobile devices, THE Layout Component SHALL NOT render the MobileNavigation component
2. WHEN accessing navigation on mobile, THE Layout Component SHALL provide navigation only through the existing burger menu
3. WHEN the MobileNavigation component is removed, THE Layout Component SHALL maintain all existing navigation functionality through the burger menu
4. WHEN viewing on desktop, THE Layout Component SHALL continue to show the desktop navigation without any changes
5. WHEN the bottom tab bar is removed, THE Layout Component SHALL ensure no broken imports or references remain

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to access all navigation options through the burger menu, so that I have a consistent and uncluttered navigation experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening the burger menu on mobile, THE Layout Component SHALL display all navigation items that were previously in the bottom tab bar
2. WHEN navigation items have badges (like unread counts), THE Layout Component SHALL display these badges in the burger menu
3. WHEN clicking navigation items in the burger menu, THE Layout Component SHALL navigate to the correct routes
4. WHEN the burger menu is open, THE Layout Component SHALL close the menu after navigation selection
5. WHEN accessing the burger menu, THE Layout Component SHALL maintain the same visual hierarchy and organization as the current mobile menu

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MobileNavigation component removal to be clean and maintainable, so that the codebase remains organized and free of unused code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN removing the MobileNavigation component, THE Layout Component SHALL remove the import statement for MobileNavigation
2. WHEN the component is removed, THE Layout Component SHALL remove the MobileNavigation JSX element from the render method
3. WHEN cleaning up the code, THE System SHALL identify if the MobileNavigation component file can be safely deleted or if it's used elsewhere
4. WHEN removing the navigation, THE Layout Component SHALL maintain proper TypeScript types and interfaces
5. WHEN the changes are complete, THE Layout Component SHALL pass all existing tests and linting rules
