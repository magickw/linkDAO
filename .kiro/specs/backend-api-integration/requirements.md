# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The marketplace frontend has been successfully implemented with 85% functionality, but critical backend API routes are missing, preventing the frontend from accessing real data. The frontend services exist and make proper API calls, but the Express.js backend lacks the corresponding route handlers, resulting in 404 errors. Additionally, the database needs to be populated with sample data to support development and testing. This feature implements the missing backend API infrastructure to complete the marketplace functionality.

## Glossary

- **Express Routes**: HTTP endpoint handlers that process API requests from the frontend
- **Route Controllers**: Functions that handle business logic for specific API endpoints
- **Database Seeding**: The process of populating the database with initial sample data
- **API Integration**: The connection between frontend services and backend endpoints
- **Marketplace Service**: Frontend service that makes API calls to backend endpoints
- **Enhanced Marketplace Service**: Frontend service with retry logic and error handling
- **Route Handlers**: Express.js functions that process HTTP requests and return responses

5. THE backend SHALL implement POST `/api/orders` route for creating new orders from cart
6. WHEN users are authenticated THE cart SHALL sync between frontend localStorage and backend database

### Requirement 4: Seller Management API Routes

**User Story:** As a seller, I want to manage my products and store through API endpoints, so that I can create, update, and track my marketplace listings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE backend SHALL implement POST `/api/sellers/listings` route for creating new product listings
2. THE backend SHALL implement PUT `/api/sellers/listings/:id` route for updating existing listings
3. THE backend SHALL implement DELETE `/api/sellers/listings/:id` route for removing listings
4. THE backend SHALL implement GET `/api/sellers/dashboard` route for seller analytics and metrics
5. THE backend SHALL implement PUT `/api/sellers/profile` route for updating seller store information
6. WHEN sellers manage listings THE system SHALL validate seller ownership and permissions

### Requirement 5: Database Schema and Sample Data

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database populated with realistic sample data, so that I can test marketplace functionality and demonstrate features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE database SHALL contain at least 50 sample product listings across multiple categories
2. THE database SHALL contain at least 10 sample seller profiles with complete information
3. THE database SHALL contain sample user accounts for testing authentication flows
4. THE database SHALL contain sample cart and order data for testing e-commerce workflows
5. WHEN the application starts THE sample data SHALL be available for immediate testing
6. THE sample data SHALL include realistic product images, descriptions, and pricing

### Requirement 6: API Response Standardization

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent API response formats, so that frontend services can reliably process backend data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE backend SHALL return all API responses in a standardized format with success/error indicators
2. WHEN API calls succeed THE response SHALL include data, success: true, and appropriate HTTP status codes
3. WHEN API calls fail THE response SHALL include error messages, success: false, and appropriate HTTP status codes
4. THE backend SHALL implement proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 500)
5. THE backend SHALL include pagination metadata for list endpoints (total, page, limit)
6. THE backend SHALL validate request parameters and return detailed validation error messages

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can monitor system health and debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE backend SHALL implement global error handling middleware for unhandled exceptions
2. WHEN errors occur THE system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces
3. THE backend SHALL implement request logging middleware for API call monitoring
4. WHEN validation fails THE system SHALL return specific field-level error messages
5. THE backend SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse
6. THE system SHALL log performance metrics for slow API calls

### Requirement 8: Data Validation and Security

**User Story:** As a security-conscious system, I want robust input validation and security measures, so that the marketplace is protected from malicious attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE backend SHALL validate all input parameters using schema validation (Joi or similar)
