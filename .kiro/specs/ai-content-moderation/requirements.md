# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive AI-powered content moderation system for our Web3 social platform. The system will protect users and brands while preserving crypto-native expression through automated detection, community reporting, human review, and DAO-backed appeals. It will moderate posts, comments, images/video, NFTs, marketplace listings, bids, direct messages (opt-in), and usernames using an ensemble of AI models with configurable thresholds based on user reputation and content type.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Modal Content Detection

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to automatically detect harmful content across all media types, so that I can maintain a safe environment while minimizing manual review overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is submitted THEN the system SHALL scan text using OpenAI Moderation API and Perspective API for toxicity detection
2. WHEN images or videos are uploaded THEN the system SHALL process them through Google Vision API and AWS Rekognition for NSFW, violence, and harmful content detection
3. WHEN links are shared THEN the system SHALL check URLs against Google Safe Browsing and PhishFort databases for malicious content
4. WHEN content contains potential PII THEN the system SHALL detect and flag phone numbers, addresses, seed phrases, and personal documents
5. WHEN marketplace listings are created THEN the system SHALL apply additional checks for counterfeits, dangerous items, and scam patterns

### Requirement 2: Risk-Based Decision Engine

**User Story:** As a content moderator, I want the system to make intelligent decisions based on confidence scores and user reputation, so that I can focus on edge cases while maintaining platform safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI confidence is â‰¥95% for blocking categories THEN the system SHALL auto-block content and notify the author with appeal option
2. WHEN AI confidence is 70-95% for sensitive categories THEN the system SHALL quarantine content for human review
3. WHEN AI confidence is <70% THEN the system SHALL publish content with silent logging for monitoring
4. WHEN users have low reputation or are new accounts THEN the system SHALL apply stricter thresholds and additional verification steps
5. WHEN content contains seed phrases or obvious scam patterns THEN the system SHALL immediately block regardless of other factors

### Requirement 3: Community Reporting and Escalation

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to report harmful content and have my reports weighted by my reputation, so that the community can help maintain platform quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users report content THEN the system SHALL weight reports based on reporter reputation and history
2. WHEN aggregate weighted reports exceed threshold THEN the system SHALL escalate content to human review queue
3. WHEN users submit false reports repeatedly THEN the system SHALL reduce their reporting weight and apply penalties
4. WHEN high-reputation users report content THEN the system SHALL fast-track the review process
5. WHEN content receives multiple reports for the same violation THEN the system SHALL merge reports and increase priority

### Requirement 4: Human Moderation Interface

**User Story:** As a human moderator, I want a comprehensive interface to review flagged content with full context, so that I can make informed decisions efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN moderators access the review queue THEN the system SHALL display content with AI scores, user history, and wallet context
2. WHEN moderators make decisions THEN the system SHALL provide one-click actions with policy templates
3. WHEN moderators need evidence THEN the system SHALL store decision rationale and evidence as immutable IPFS CIDs
4. WHEN moderators review appeals THEN the system SHALL show original decision context and new evidence
5. WHEN moderators take action THEN the system SHALL log all decisions with timestamps and reasoning

### Requirement 5: DAO-Backed Appeals System

**User Story:** As a user whose content was moderated, I want to appeal decisions through a decentralized jury system, so that I have fair recourse against automated or human moderation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users appeal moderation decisions THEN the system SHALL require stake deposit to prevent frivolous appeals
2. WHEN appeals are submitted THEN the system SHALL randomly select qualified jurors based on reputation and stake
3. WHEN jurors vote on appeals THEN the system SHALL use commit-reveal voting to prevent coordination
4. WHEN appeal decisions are finalized THEN the system SHALL execute on-chain and update user reputation accordingly
5. WHEN jurors make incorrect decisions THEN the system SHALL slash their stake as determined by appeal outcomes

### Requirement 6: Privacy and Compliance

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want my privacy protected during content moderation, so that my personal information is not unnecessarily exposed or stored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content contains PII THEN the system SHALL redact sensitive information before storage
2. WHEN processing biometric data THEN the system SHALL use perceptual hashes instead of storing raw data
3. WHEN users opt into DM scanning THEN the system SHALL only scan metadata unless content is reported
4. WHEN storing evidence THEN the system SHALL use private storage with short TTL for raw artifacts
5. WHEN operating in different regions THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate geofencing and compliance rules

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want content moderation to be fast and reliable, so that my posting experience is not significantly impacted by safety measures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text content is submitted THEN the system SHALL complete moderation within 3 seconds for fast lane processing
2. WHEN images/videos are submitted THEN the system SHALL complete moderation within 30 seconds for slow lane processing
3. WHEN vendor APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to single-vendor or publish with warning labels
4. WHEN duplicate content is detected THEN the system SHALL use cached results from perceptual/text hashes
5. WHEN system load is high THEN the system SHALL prioritize based on content type and user reputation

### Requirement 8: Reputation Integration

**User Story:** As a platform participant, I want my reputation to be affected by moderation outcomes, so that there are meaningful incentives for good behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users violate policies THEN the system SHALL reduce their reputation and increase future moderation strictness
2. WHEN users make helpful reports THEN the system SHALL reward them with reputation points and token incentives
3. WHEN users have repeated violations THEN the system SHALL apply progressive penalties including rate limits and temporary bans
4. WHEN users successfully appeal incorrect decisions THEN the system SHALL restore reputation and compensate for false positives
5. WHEN users participate as jurors THEN the system SHALL reward accurate decisions and penalize poor judgment

### Requirement 9: Marketplace-Specific Protections

**User Story:** As a marketplace participant, I want enhanced protections against fraud and counterfeits, so that I can trade safely in the Web3 environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN high-value NFTs are listed THEN the system SHALL require proof-of-ownership signatures from holding wallets
2. WHEN listings contain brand keywords THEN the system SHALL apply enhanced counterfeit detection models
3. WHEN sellers have low reputation THEN the system SHALL require additional verification for high-risk categories
4. WHEN listings match known scam patterns THEN the system SHALL auto-block and flag for investigation
5. WHEN users attempt to list dangerous or illegal items THEN the system SHALL prevent publication and notify authorities if required

### Requirement 10: Observability and Continuous Improvement

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive metrics and logging, so that I can monitor system performance and continuously improve moderation accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN moderation decisions are made THEN the system SHALL log structured data including scores, latency, and costs
2. WHEN false positives occur THEN the system SHALL track appeal overturn rates by category and model
3. WHEN new policies are deployed THEN the system SHALL support canary rollouts and shadow evaluation
4. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators with actionable metrics
5. WHEN policy effectiveness changes THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards for decision analysis and threshold tuning
