# Remove Mock Data - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the systematic removal of mock data throughout the application and its replacement with real database operations. The goal is to transition from development mock data to production-ready database-driven functionality while maintaining application stability and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Community Mock Data Removal

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove community mock data so that the application uses real database operations for community functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads community data THEN it SHALL fetch from the database instead of mock data
2. WHEN a user views community information THEN it SHALL display real data from the community service
3. WHEN a user joins or leaves a community THEN it SHALL update the database instead of mock arrays
4. WHEN community statistics are displayed THEN they SHALL reflect actual database counts
5. IF the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling instead of falling back to mock data

### Requirement 2: Product/Marketplace Mock Data Removal

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real marketplace listings so that I can interact with actual products and services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the marketplace loads THEN it SHALL display products from the database
2. WHEN a user searches for products THEN it SHALL query the database instead of filtering mock arrays
3. WHEN product categories are displayed THEN they SHALL reflect actual database categories
4. WHEN auction data is shown THEN it SHALL use real auction records from the database
5. WHEN product details are viewed THEN they SHALL come from the database with real seller information

### Requirement 3: User and Profile Mock Data Removal

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real user profiles and social connections so that I can interact with actual community members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN suggested users are displayed THEN they SHALL come from the user recommendation service
2. WHEN user profiles are viewed THEN they SHALL show real user data from the database
3. WHEN follower/following counts are shown THEN they SHALL reflect actual database relationships
4. WHEN user reputation is displayed THEN it SHALL use the real reputation system
5. WHEN user avatars are shown THEN they SHALL use real uploaded images or proper placeholder service

### Requirement 4: Governance and DAO Mock Data Removal

**User Story:** As a DAO member, I want to see real governance proposals and voting data so that I can participate in actual governance processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN governance proposals are displayed THEN they SHALL come from the governance service
2. WHEN voting statistics are shown THEN they SHALL reflect actual votes from the database
3. WHEN DAO treasury information is displayed THEN it SHALL use real on-chain data
4. WHEN proposal deadlines are shown THEN they SHALL use actual proposal end times
5. WHEN governance tokens are referenced THEN they SHALL use real token contract addresses

### Requirement 5: Feed and Content Mock Data Removal

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real posts and content in my feed so that I can engage with actual community discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the feed loads THEN it SHALL display real posts from the database
2. WHEN trending content is shown THEN it SHALL use real engagement metrics
3. WHEN hashtags are displayed THEN they SHALL reflect actual usage statistics
4. WHEN post reactions are shown THEN they SHALL use the real reaction system
5. WHEN comments are displayed THEN they SHALL come from the database

### Requirement 6: Fallback and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle data loading gracefully so that I have a good experience even when data is unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
2. WHEN no data is available THEN the system SHALL display empty states with helpful messaging
3. WHEN API calls timeout THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms
4. WHEN critical services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully
5. IF mock data is needed for development THEN it SHALL be clearly separated and not used in production

### Requirement 7: Performance and Caching

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly so that I can access real data efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN real data replaces mock data THEN response times SHALL remain acceptable
2. WHEN frequently accessed data is requested THEN it SHALL use appropriate caching strategies
3. WHEN large datasets are loaded THEN they SHALL use pagination and lazy loading
4. WHEN real-time data is needed THEN it SHALL use efficient update mechanisms
5. WHEN cache invalidation occurs THEN it SHALL maintain data consistency

### Requirement 8: Development and Testing Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain development and testing capabilities so that I can continue to develop features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL use test fixtures instead of mock data
2. WHEN developing locally THEN there SHALL be seed data available for testing
3. WHEN running in development mode THEN there SHALL be clear indicators of data source
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN there SHALL be proper logging for data operations
5. WHEN setting up new environments THEN there SHALL be migration scripts for initial data
