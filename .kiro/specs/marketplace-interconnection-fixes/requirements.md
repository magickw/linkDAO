# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The marketplace currently has critical interconnection issues that prevent users from navigating between pages and completing basic workflows. These issues include inconsistent URL routing patterns, broken navigation between product cards and detail pages, missing page implementations, and disconnected components that don't properly integrate with each other. This feature addresses these fundamental navigation and integration problems to create a cohesive marketplace experience.

## Glossary

- **ProductCard**: The reusable component that displays product information in grid/list views
- **SimpleProductCard**: A basic product display component currently used in marketplace.tsx
- **SellerStorePage**: The page that displays a seller's store with their listings
- **ProductDetailPage**: The page that shows detailed information about a specific product
- **MarketplaceService**: The service layer that handles API calls for marketplace data
- **URL Routing**: The system that maps URLs to specific pages and components
- **Navigation Flow**: The sequence of pages a user visits to complete a task
