# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines requirements for transforming the Communities page into a truly Web3-native experience with enhanced visual hierarchy, token integration, on-chain verification, and advanced engagement features. Building upon the existing community-page-enhancements foundation, this feature focuses on blockchain-specific functionality, token economics, governance integration, and Web3 user experience patterns that make the platform feel native to the decentralized ecosystem.

The current Communities page provides solid functionality but lacks the Web3-specific features that would make it feel truly native to blockchain users. These enhancements will integrate token staking, on-chain verification, real-time token prices, gas fee displays, and advanced governance widgets to create a comprehensive Web3 social experience.
