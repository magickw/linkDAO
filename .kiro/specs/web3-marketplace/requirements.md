The marketplace will leverage blockchain technology to provide decentralized commerce with lower fees, transparent reviews, global accessibility, and Web3-native features including cryptocurrency payments, NFT integration, and DAO governance.

The platform will support both physical goods and digital services, implementing a phased approach starting with Web3-native products and expanding to mainstream categories. Key differentiators include elimination of intermediary costs, direct peer-to-peer transactions, blockchain-based authenticity verification, and community-driven governance.
