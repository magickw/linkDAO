# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current marketplace payment system lacks intelligent payment method prioritization, leading to poor user experience when ETH prices are high. Users are often defaulted to expensive ETH transactions when more cost-effective alternatives like stablecoins (USDC) or fiat payments are available. This feature implements smart payment method prioritization that considers cost-effectiveness, user preferences, and market conditions to provide the best payment experience.

## Glossary

- **Payment_Method_Prioritization_System**: The system component that determines the order and default selection of payment methods presented to users
- **Stablecoin**: Cryptocurrency tokens pegged to stable assets like USD (e.g., USDC, USDT)
- **Gas_Fee_Threshold**: The maximum acceptable gas fee amount that triggers alternative payment method suggestions
- **Payment_Method_Selector**: The UI component that displays available payment methods in prioritized order
- **Cost_Effectiveness_Calculator**: Service that calculates total transaction costs including gas fees and exchange rates

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Stablecoin-First Payment Prioritization

**User Story:** As a buyer, I want stablecoins (USDC) to be the default payment method when available, so that I can avoid high ETH gas fees and price volatility while making purchases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates checkout THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL display USDC as the first payment option if available on the current network
2. WHEN multiple stablecoins are available THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL prioritize USDC over USDT and other stablecoins
3. WHEN the user has sufficient USDC balance THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL pre-select USDC as the default payment method
4. WHEN USDC is not available on the current network THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL display the next available stablecoin as the primary option
5. WHEN no stablecoins are available THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL proceed to the next priority tier (fiat payment)

### Requirement 2: Fiat Payment as Secondary Option

**User Story:** As a buyer, I want fiat payment to be prominently displayed as the second option, so that I can avoid cryptocurrency complexity and volatility when preferred.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN stablecoins are unavailable or insufficient THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL display fiat payment as the primary alternative
2. WHEN ETH gas fees exceed the Gas_Fee_Threshold THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL promote fiat payment above ETH in the display order
3. WHEN a user selects fiat payment THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL process payment through Stripe regardless of crypto balance availability
4. WHEN fiat payment is displayed THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL show clear pricing in the user's local currency
5. IF fiat payment processing is unavailable THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL display an appropriate message and fallback to crypto options

### Requirement 3: ETH as Fallback Option

**User Story:** As a buyer, I want ETH to be available as a payment option but not prioritized when gas fees are high, so that I can still complete transactions when other methods are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ETH gas fees are below the Gas_Fee_Threshold THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL display ETH as a viable payment option
2. WHEN ETH gas fees exceed the Gas_Fee_Threshold THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL display ETH with a warning about high transaction costs
3. WHEN ETH is the only available payment method THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL display it with cost breakdown and confirmation prompts
4. WHEN a user selects ETH payment THEN the Cost_Effectiveness_Calculator SHALL display total transaction cost including gas fees
5. IF ETH gas estimation fails THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL provide alternative payment methods and retry options

### Requirement 4: Dynamic Cost-Based Prioritization

**User Story:** As a buyer, I want the payment method order to automatically adjust based on current market conditions and transaction costs, so that I always see the most cost-effective options first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Cost_Effectiveness_Calculator determines total transaction costs THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL reorder payment methods by cost-effectiveness
2. WHEN gas fees change significantly during checkout THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL update the payment method order in real-time
3. WHEN multiple payment methods have similar costs THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL maintain the base priority order (stablecoins → fiat → ETH)
4. WHEN cost calculations are unavailable THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL fall back to the default priority order
5. WHEN displaying payment methods THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL show estimated total costs for each option

### Requirement 5: User Preference Learning and Override

**User Story:** As a buyer, I want the system to remember my payment preferences while still allowing me to choose different methods, so that my preferred payment method is prioritized in future transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a transaction THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL record the selected payment method as a preference indicator
2. WHEN a user has established payment preferences THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL boost the preferred method in the display order while maintaining cost-effectiveness considerations
3. WHEN a user manually selects a different payment method THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL allow the selection without restriction
4. WHEN displaying payment methods THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL indicate the user's previously preferred method with appropriate visual cues
5. IF user preferences conflict with cost-effectiveness THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL display both options with clear cost comparisons

### Requirement 6: Network-Specific Payment Method Availability

**User Story:** As a buyer, I want to see only payment methods that are actually available on my current network, so that I don't encounter errors when trying to complete transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects to a specific blockchain network THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL display only payment methods supported on that network
2. WHEN switching between networks THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL update available payment methods and maintain prioritization logic
3. WHEN a preferred payment method is unavailable on the current network THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL suggest network switching or alternative payment methods
4. WHEN network detection fails THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL display all payment methods with appropriate network requirement indicators
5. WHEN displaying payment methods THEN the Payment_Method_Prioritization_System SHALL show network compatibility information for each option
