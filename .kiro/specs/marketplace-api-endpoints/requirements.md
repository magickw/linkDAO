# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current marketplace frontend is experiencing critical API endpoint failures that prevent core functionality from working. Console errors show 404 responses for seller profile endpoints, marketplace listings, authentication services, and onboarding workflows. This feature addresses the missing backend API endpoints and service integrations needed to support the existing frontend marketplace components.

The frontend components are already built and making requests to specific API endpoints, but the backend services and routes are either missing or misconfigured. This spec focuses on implementing the exact API endpoints that the frontend expects, ensuring proper error handling, and establishing reliable service connections.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Seller Profile API Endpoints

**User Story:** As a seller using the marketplace interface, I want my profile data to load and save correctly, so that I can manage my seller information and onboarding status.

3. WHEN the frontend requests `/api/marketplace/seller/onboarding/{walletAddress}` THEN the system SHALL return onboarding step status and completion data
4. WHEN seller profile creation fails THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with actionable error messages
5. WHEN wallet address is invalid THEN the system SHALL validate address format and return appropriate error codes
6. IF seller profile doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL return null data instead of throwing 404 errors for profile fetching

### Requirement 2: Marketplace Listings API Integration

**User Story:** As a user browsing the marketplace, I want to see available listings and products, so that I can discover and purchase items from sellers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend requests marketplace listings THEN the system SHALL provide `/marketplace/listings` endpoint with pagination support
2. WHEN listings are requested with filters THEN the system SHALL support query parameters for limit, sortBy, and sortOrder

4. WHEN listings data is returned THEN the system SHALL include all required fields (id, title, price, images, seller info)
5. WHEN the enhanced marketplace service fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback data or graceful degradation
6. IF database connection fails THEN the system SHALL return cached listings data when available

### Requirement 3: Authentication and Wallet Integration

**User Story:** As a user connecting my wallet, I want reliable authentication that doesn't fail with connector errors, so that I can access marketplace features securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN wallet authentication is attempted THEN the system SHALL handle ConnectorNotConnectedError gracefully
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms
3. WHEN auto-login is triggered THEN the system SHALL check connection status before attempting authentication
4. WHEN signature verification fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
5. WHEN wallet connection is lost THEN the system SHALL maintain user session where possible and prompt for reconnection
6. IF authentication service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL allow limited marketplace browsing without wallet connection

### Requirement 4: Reputation and User Data Services

**User Story:** As a marketplace participant, I want my reputation data and user information to load correctly, so that trust indicators and profile information display properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reputation data is requested THEN the system SHALL provide `/marketplace/reputation/{walletAddress}` endpoint
2. WHEN reputation service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return default reputation values instead of 500 errors
3. WHEN user profile data is fetched THEN the system SHALL handle missing profiles gracefully
4. WHEN reputation calculation fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and return cached reputation data
5. WHEN multiple reputation requests occur THEN the system SHALL implement caching to prevent excessive API calls
6. IF reputation data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and provide fallback values

### Requirement 5: Service Worker and Caching Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a user accessing the marketplace, I want reliable caching and offline capabilities, so that the application performs well and works during network issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service worker initializes THEN the system SHALL handle cache.addAll failures gracefully
2. WHEN static assets are cached THEN the system SHALL verify resource availability before caching
3. WHEN cache operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue without breaking functionality
4. WHEN offline mode is detected THEN the system SHALL serve cached content and show offline indicators
5. WHEN cache storage is full THEN the system SHALL implement cache cleanup strategies
6. IF service worker registration fails THEN the system SHALL continue normal operation without caching features

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Logging Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the marketplace, I want comprehensive error logging and handling, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints return errors THEN the system SHALL provide structured error responses with error codes and messages
2. WHEN frontend requests fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including request parameters and stack traces
3. WHEN service connections fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL send alerts to monitoring systems
5. WHEN users encounter errors THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
6. IF error logging service fails THEN the system SHALL maintain local error logs and queue for later transmission

### Requirement 7: Database Integration and Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a marketplace operator, I want reliable data storage and retrieval, so that user data, listings, and transactions are properly persisted and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN seller profiles are created THEN the system SHALL persist data to the database with proper validation
2. WHEN listings are submitted THEN the system SHALL store all listing data and make it immediately available via API
3. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL implement fallback mechanisms and error recovery
4. WHEN data integrity issues occur THEN the system SHALL validate data and prevent corruption
5. WHEN concurrent updates happen THEN the system SHALL handle race conditions and maintain data consistency
6. IF database connection is lost THEN the system SHALL queue operations and retry when connection is restored

### Requirement 8: API Response Standardization

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent API response formats, so that error handling and data processing can be implemented reliably across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints return success responses THEN the system SHALL use consistent JSON structure with data, status, and metadata fields
2. WHEN API endpoints return errors THEN the system SHALL use standardized error format with code, message, and details
3. WHEN pagination is required THEN the system SHALL include pagination metadata (total, page, limit, hasNext)
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return field-specific error messages in consistent format
5. WHEN API versions change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility and provide migration paths
6. IF response data is missing THEN the system SHALL return null values instead of undefined to prevent frontend errors

### Requirement 9: Performance and Rate Limiting

**User Story:** As a marketplace user, I want fast API responses and protection against service abuse, so that the platform remains responsive and stable under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL respond within 500ms for cached data and 2 seconds for database queries
2. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 status with retry-after headers
3. WHEN multiple requests are made for the same data THEN the system SHALL implement request deduplication
4. WHEN high traffic occurs THEN the system SHALL scale API services automatically
