# Service Worker Cache Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the current service worker cache implementation to provide robust offline capabilities, improved performance, and feature-specific caching strategies aligned with the platform's core features: social feed, Reddit-style communities, Amazon-like marketplace, and wallet-to-wallet messaging.

The current implementation provides basic caching with three cache stores (static-v2, dynamic-v2, images-v2), periodic cleanup, and simple offline queuing. This enhancement will modernize the architecture using Workbox, implement sophisticated caching strategies, and provide privacy-first storage for sensitive data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Modern Service Worker Architecture

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want a robust and reliable offline experience that works consistently across all platform features, so that I can continue using the application even with poor network connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service worker is registered THEN it SHALL use Workbox for routing strategies and cache management
2. WHEN the application loads THEN navigation preload SHALL be enabled to reduce first paint latency
3. WHEN caching strategies are applied THEN they SHALL include NetworkFirst, Stale-While-Revalidate, and CacheFirst with appropriate plugins
4. WHEN the service worker updates THEN it SHALL perform safe cache migration and version management
5. WHEN a user logs out or switches accounts THEN auth-bound caches SHALL be cleared automatically

### Requirement 2: Facebook-like Feed Caching

**User Story:** As a social media user, I want my feed to load quickly and work offline with the latest cached content, so that I can browse posts even when my connection is unstable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN feed endpoints are accessed THEN they SHALL use NetworkFirst strategy with background refresh
2. WHEN scrolling through the feed THEN next page URLs and media thumbnails SHALL be predictively preloaded
3. WHEN new content is posted or deleted THEN impacted cache entries SHALL be invalidated using tag-based invalidation
4. WHEN new content is available THEN open tabs SHALL be notified via BroadcastChannel to prompt UI refresh
5. WHEN offline THEN the last-good cached feed SHALL be available as fallback

### Requirement 3: Reddit-style Community Caching

**User Story:** As a community member, I want community pages and posts to load instantly and work offline, so that I can participate in discussions without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing community pages THEN they SHALL use Stale-While-Revalidate strategy for content freshness
2. WHEN entering a community THEN top N posts, member counts, and community assets SHALL be preloaded
3. WHEN posting or commenting offline THEN actions SHALL be queued via BackgroundSync with retry logic
4. WHEN related communities are displayed THEN their icons SHALL be batch preloaded with size limits
5. WHEN community data changes THEN relevant cache entries SHALL be invalidated and updated

### Requirement 4: Amazon-like Marketplace Caching

**User Story:** As a marketplace user, I want product listings and images to load quickly with up-to-date pricing, so that I can browse and shop efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing product listings THEN they SHALL use NetworkFirst strategy for inventory and pricing
2. WHEN viewing product images THEN they SHALL use CacheFirst with expiration for static content
3. WHEN price or inventory data is cached THEN it SHALL have low maxAgeSeconds with ETag validation
4. WHEN managing cart or wishlist offline THEN data SHALL be stored in IndexedDB and synced on reconnect
5. WHEN loading product media THEN responsive images SHALL be optimized and critical images preloaded

### Requirement 5: Privacy-First Wallet Messaging

**User Story:** As a wallet user, I want my messages to be secure and private while still providing offline functionality, so that my communications remain confidential.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing message data THEN message bodies SHALL NOT be cached in CacheStorage
2. WHEN messages are stored offline THEN they SHALL use IndexedDB with encryption-at-rest
3. WHEN accessing conversation lists THEN they SHALL use NetworkFirst strategy
4. WHEN sending messages offline THEN they SHALL be queued via BackgroundSync with ordering preservation
5. WHEN handling message attachments THEN they SHALL respect privacy headers and avoid caching sensitive content

### Requirement 6: Performance and Quota Management

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the caching system to manage storage efficiently without impacting device performance, so that the application remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cache storage exceeds threshold THEN proactive cleanup SHALL prioritize large image entries via LRU
2. WHEN setting cache limits THEN maxEntries and maxAgeSeconds SHALL be configured per cache type
3. WHEN estimating storage usage THEN navigator.storage.estimate SHALL be monitored continuously
4. WHEN the app shell loads THEN core assets SHALL be precached for immediate offline usability
5. WHEN cache operations occur THEN they SHALL respect Cache-Control and Vary headers

### Requirement 7: Security and Data Integrity

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the caching system to handle my data securely and respect privacy controls, so that my information remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN caching responses THEN only 200 OK responses with appropriate content-types SHALL be cached
2. WHEN handling authenticated requests THEN responses with Authorization headers SHALL be scoped appropriately
3. WHEN caching cross-origin requests THEN CORS policies SHALL be respected
4. WHEN storing user-specific data THEN caches SHALL be bound to user sessions
5. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN PII SHALL be avoided in cache unless encrypted in IndexedDB

### Requirement 8: Enhanced API and Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive API for cache management that integrates seamlessly with existing services, so that I can implement feature-specific caching logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using cache strategies THEN fetchWithStrategy method SHALL provide unified access
2. WHEN storing cache metadata THEN putWithMetadata SHALL write to both cache and IndexedDB
3. WHEN invalidating caches THEN invalidateByTag SHALL support tag-based cache clearing
4. WHEN managing offline actions THEN flushOfflineQueue SHALL migrate from localStorage to BackgroundSync
5. WHEN monitoring cache performance THEN metrics SHALL include hit rates, eviction counts, and sync status

### Requirement 9: Testing and Observability

**User Story:** As a platform maintainer, I want comprehensive testing and monitoring of the cache system, so that I can ensure reliability and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN cache strategies, metadata, and invalidation SHALL be verified
2. WHEN performing E2E tests THEN offline/online transitions and feature continuity SHALL be validated
3. WHEN monitoring performance THEN per-cache hit/miss ratios SHALL be tracked
4. WHEN errors occur THEN cache failures SHALL be logged with context
5. WHEN analyzing usage THEN queue sizes and sync success rates SHALL be reported

### Requirement 10: Phased Implementation Support

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want the cache enhancement to be delivered incrementally with minimal risk, so that we can validate each phase before proceeding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Phase 1 THEN Workbox, precaching, and basic strategies SHALL be delivered
2. WHEN implementing Phase 2 THEN metadata management and background sync SHALL be added
3. WHEN implementing Phase 3 THEN marketplace and messaging features SHALL be integrated
4. WHEN implementing Phase 4 THEN advanced features and comprehensive testing SHALL be completed
5. WHEN each phase completes THEN backward compatibility SHALL be maintained
