# LDAO Token Acquisition System Design

## Overview

The LDAO Token Acquisition System provides a comprehensive multi-channel approach for users to acquire LDAO tokens through direct purchases, DEX trading, and earn-to-own mechanisms. The system integrates smart contracts, payment processors, and frontend services to create a seamless token acquisition experience while maintaining security and regulatory compliance.

### Component Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Frontend Components**: User interfaces for token acquisition
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic and external integrations
3. **Smart Contract Layer**: On-chain token management and security
4. **External Integrations**: Third-party payment and DEX services

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. LDAO Treasury Smart Contract

**Purpose**: Manages direct token sales, pricing, and treasury operations

**Key Functions**:
```solidity
interface ILDAOTreasury {
    function purchaseTokens(uint256 amount, address paymentToken) external payable;
    function setDynamicPrice(uint256 newPrice) external;
    function applyVolumeDiscount(uint256 purchaseAmount) external view returns (uint256);
    function enableKYCPurchase(address user, uint256 limit) external;
    function withdrawTreasuryFunds(address token, uint256 amount) external;
}
```

**Features**:
- Dynamic pricing engine starting at $0.01 per LDAO
- Volume-based discount tiers (5%-15%)
- KYC integration for higher purchase limits
- Multi-signature admin controls
- Emergency pause functionality

### 2. LDAO Acquisition Service

**Purpose**: Orchestrates token acquisition workflows and external integrations

**Key Methods**:
```typescript
interface ILDAOAcquisitionService {
    purchaseWithFiat(amount: number, paymentMethod: PaymentMethod): Promise<PurchaseResult>;
    purchaseWithCrypto(amount: number, token: string): Promise<PurchaseResult>;
    swapOnDEX(fromToken: string, toToken: string, amount: number): Promise<SwapResult>;
    earnTokens(activity: EarnActivity, userId: string): Promise<EarnResult>;
    bridgeTokens(fromChain: string, toChain: string, amount: number): Promise<BridgeResult>;
}
```

**Integrations**:
- Stripe for fiat payments
- MoonPay for crypto on-ramps
- Uniswap V3 for DEX trading
- Cross-chain bridge protocols

### 3. Frontend Components

#### LDAO Purchase Modal
- Multi-step purchase flow
- Payment method selection
- Real-time price quotes
- Transaction status tracking

#### Earn LDAO Page
- Gamified earning interface
- Progress tracking
- Reward history
- Achievement system

### 4. Payment Processing Integration

**Fiat Payment Flow**:
1. User selects fiat payment option
2. Stripe processes payment
3. Backend converts fiat to crypto
4. Treasury contract mints tokens
5. Tokens transferred to user wallet

**Crypto Payment Flow**:
1. User connects wallet
2. Approves token spending
3. Treasury contract processes payment
4. Tokens minted and transferred

## Data Models

### Purchase Transaction
```typescript
interface PurchaseTransaction {
    id: string;
    userId: string;
    amount: number;
    paymentMethod: 'fiat' | 'crypto';
    paymentToken: string;
    pricePerToken: number;
    discountApplied: number;
    status: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'failed';
    txHash?: string;
    createdAt: Date;
    completedAt?: Date;
}
```

### Earning Activity
```typescript
interface EarningActivity {
    id: string;
    userId: string;
    activityType: 'post' | 'comment' | 'referral' | 'marketplace';
    tokensEarned: number;
    multiplier: number;
    isPremiumBonus: boolean;
    createdAt: Date;
}
```

### Staking Position
```typescript
interface StakingPosition {
    id: string;
    userId: string;
    amount: number;
    lockPeriod: number; // in days
    aprRate: number;
    startDate: Date;
    endDate: Date;
    isAutoCompound: boolean;
    status: 'active' | 'completed' | 'withdrawn';
}
```

## Error Handling

### Smart Contract Error Handling
- Custom error messages for different failure scenarios
- Circuit breaker pattern for emergency stops
- Reentrancy guards on all state-changing functions
- Input validation and bounds checking

### Frontend Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for network issues
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for failed transactions
- Fallback payment methods

### Backend Error Handling
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Transaction rollback mechanisms
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Automated alerting for critical failures

## Testing Strategy

### Smart Contract Testing
```typescript
describe('LDAO Treasury Contract', () => {
    it('should apply correct volume discounts');
    it('should enforce purchase limits');
    it('should handle emergency pause');
    it('should prevent unauthorized access');
    it('should calculate dynamic pricing correctly');
});
```

### Integration Testing
