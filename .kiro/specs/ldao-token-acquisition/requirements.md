# LDAO Token Acquisition System Requirements

## Introduction

The LDAO Token Acquisition System enables users to obtain LDAO tokens through multiple channels including direct purchases, DEX trading, and earn-to-own mechanisms. This system addresses the current limitation where users can only acquire LDAO tokens through staking rewards and tipping, providing comprehensive acquisition pathways for platform growth and user engagement.

## Glossary

- **LDAO Token**: The native ERC-20 utility token of the LinkDAO platform with 1 billion total supply
- **Treasury Contract**: Smart contract managing direct token sales and pricing mechanisms
- **DEX Integration**: Decentralized exchange connectivity for token trading
- **Earn-to-Own**: Gamified system allowing users to earn tokens through platform activities
- **Payment Processor**: Third-party services handling fiat-to-crypto conversions
- **Acquisition Service**: Frontend service orchestrating token acquisition workflows
- **Pricing Engine**: Dynamic pricing system based on demand and platform metrics
