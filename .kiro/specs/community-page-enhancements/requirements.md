# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Communities page with sophisticated improvements to the left sidebar navigation, central feed experience, right sidebar functionality, and overall UX/UI polish. Building upon the foundation of the reddit-style community redesign and social dashboard enhancements, these improvements focus on visual recognition, multi-select filtering, inline content previews, micro-interactions, and enhanced governance integration to create a more engaging and efficient community browsing experience.

The current Communities page provides basic functionality with community listings, post feeds, and sidebar information. These enhancements will add visual polish, improved navigation patterns, richer content previews, and better integration with Web3 features like ENS names, wallet activities, and governance participation.
