# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current marketplace implementation has several critical gaps that prevent a seamless user experience. This feature addresses four main areas: enhanced seller profile management with ENS support, robust image storage infrastructure, proper listing visibility and database integration, and a functional checkout process with order tracking. These improvements are essential for creating a production-ready marketplace that matches modern e-commerce standards.

## Requirements

2. WHEN a seller enters an ENS handle THEN the system SHALL validate the ENS address and store it in the seller profile
3. WHEN a seller leaves the ENS handle field empty THEN the system SHALL allow profile creation without ENS
4. WHEN a seller updates their profile THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect changes on both the editing page and public store page
5. WHEN a seller uploads a store cover image THEN the system SHALL store and display the image on their public store page

7. IF ENS validation fails THEN the system SHALL show helpful error messages and allow the user to proceed without ENS

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Image Storage Solution

### Requirement 3: Listing Visibility and Database Integration

5. IF a listing creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and allow retry
6. WHEN listings are displayed THEN the system SHALL show accurate and up-to-date information from the database

### Requirement 4: Functional Checkout Process and Order Management

**User Story:** As a buyer, I want to complete purchases using various payment methods (crypto, fiat, or escrow) with proper balance validation, and track my orders in the orders section, so that I can successfully buy products and monitor my purchase history.

#### Acceptance Criteria
