# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for completing and interconnecting the core social platform functionalities: Facebook-like feed, Reddit-style communities, and wallet-to-wallet messaging system. The platform will provide a seamless, interconnected experience where users can discover content through feeds, engage in community discussions, and communicate directly via encrypted wallet-to-wallet messaging. All features will be enhanced with intelligent caching, service worker optimization, and real-time updates to ensure optimal performance and user experience.

## Requirements
