- `placeholder`: Placeholder text for empty editor
- `showPreview`: Whether to show preview mode by default
- `disabled`: Whether the editor should be disabled
- `className`: Additional CSS classes for styling

### Markdown Processing
- Uses `marked` library for markdown-to-HTML conversion
- Implements proper async handling for markdown processing
- Sanitizes output with `DOMPurify` to prevent XSS attacks
- Supports GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) features
- Handles line breaks and other formatting properly

### UI/UX Features
- Toolbar with formatting buttons organized in logical groups
- Visual separators between button groups
- Hover and active states for all interactive elements
- Focus rings for accessibility
- Preview mode that renders formatted content
- Auto-resizing textarea that adapts to content length
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop

## Testing
The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- Proper rendering of all markdown elements
- Correct sanitization of potentially dangerous content
- Smooth operation of the formatting toolbar
- Accurate preview rendering
- Proper handling of edge cases (empty content, special characters, etc.)
