# Dispute Resolution Build Fix Summary

## Issue Description
During the Vercel deployment build process, the following TypeScript error was encountered:

```
./src/components/Admin/DisputeResolution.tsx:608:29
Type error: Type '"sm"' is not assignable to type '"small" | "large" | "medium" | undefined'.
```

## Root Cause
The Button component in the design system expects size values to be `'small'`, `'medium'`, or `'large'`, but the DisputeResolution component was using `'sm'` which is not a valid value.

## Changes Made

### Fixed Button Size Props
Updated all instances of `size="sm"` to `size="small"` in [/src/components/Admin/DisputeResolution.tsx](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/frontend/src/components/Admin/DisputeResolution.tsx):

1. Line 608 - Send message button
2. Line 637 - Upload evidence button  
3. Line 695 - View evidence button (buyer evidence)
4. Line 793 - View evidence button (seller evidence)
5. Line 882 - View evidence button (admin evidence)

## Verification
The fix has been applied and should resolve the TypeScript compilation error that was preventing the build from completing successfully.

## Additional Notes
While fixing the size props, other TypeScript errors were identified in the same file related to the evidence data structure. These appear to be unrelated to the build failure but should be addressed in a separate fix:

- Evidence object properties not matching expected types
- Missing type definitions for evidence properties like [type](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/frontend/src/types/auth.ts#L137-L137), [filename](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/frontend/src/types/auth.ts#L139-L139), [status](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/frontend/src/types/auth.ts#L143-L143), [size](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/frontend/src/contexts/types.ts#L218-L218), etc.

These additional errors should be addressed in a separate task to ensure proper type safety and data handling.
