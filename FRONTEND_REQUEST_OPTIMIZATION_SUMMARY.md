# Frontend Request Optimization & CORS Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Excessive API Requests**: Frontend was making too many requests to `/api/posts/feed`, causing backend server overload and shutdown
2. **CORS Errors**: When backend server shuts down or becomes unresponsive, CORS preflight requests fail
3. **Service Worker Retry Logic**: Service worker was aggressively retrying failed requests without proper backoff
4. **No Request Deduplication**: Multiple components could trigger simultaneous identical requests
5. **Missing Rate Limiting**: No protection against request spam on both frontend and backend

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Service Worker (`app/frontend/public/sw.js`)

**Changes Made:**
- Added exponential backoff for failed requests (30s → 1min → 2min → 4min → 5min max)
- Implemented rate limiting (max 10 requests per endpoint per minute)
- Enhanced request deduplication with better tracking
- Added request timeout (15 seconds) to prevent hanging requests
- Improved error handling and logging

**Key Features:**
```javascript
const RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW = 60000; // 1 minute
const MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = 10;
const BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER = 2;
const MAX_BACKOFF_TIME = 300000; // 5 minutes max backoff
```

### 2. Request Manager Service (`app/frontend/src/services/requestManager.ts`)

**New Service Features:**
- Centralized request handling with deduplication
- Configurable timeout, retries, and retry delays
- Rate limiting per endpoint (20 requests/minute default)
- Intelligent retry logic (don't retry 4xx errors except 429)
- Request caching and cleanup

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
await requestManager.request<Post[]>(url, options, {
  timeout: 15000,
  retries: 1,
  deduplicate: true
});
```

### 3. Optimized PostService (`app/frontend/src/services/postService.ts`)

**Changes Made:**
- Integrated with RequestManager for better request handling
- Reduced retries for feed requests (1 instead of default 2)
- Increased timeout for feed requests (15s instead of 10s)
- Better error handling and logging

### 4. Enhanced useFeed Hook (`app/frontend/src/hooks/usePosts.ts`)

**Improvements:**
- Added cache duration check (30 seconds) to prevent excessive requests
- Prevents concurrent requests when already loading
- Better error handling with fallback to cached data
- Removed problematic useEffect dependency that caused request loops
- Added `lastFetch` tracking for debugging

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
const CACHE_DURATION = 30000; // 30 seconds cache duration

// Prevent excessive requests
if (!force && now - lastFetch < CACHE_DURATION) {
  console.log('Feed fetch skipped - cache still fresh');
  return;
}

// Prevent concurrent requests
if (isLoading) {
  console.log('Feed fetch skipped - already loading');
  return;
}
```

### 5. Backend CORS & Rate Limiting

**Enhanced CORS Configuration (`app/backend/src/index.ts`):**
- Added support for Vercel preview deployments with regex patterns
- Better error handling (don't throw errors, just deny requests)
- More comprehensive allowed headers and methods
- Added `optionsSuccessStatus: 200` for legacy browser support

**New Rate Limiting Middleware (`app/backend/src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts`):**
- General limiter: 1000 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- API limiter: 500 API requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Feed limiter: 20 feed requests per minute per IP+User-Agent
- Post creation limiter: 50 posts per 15 minutes per IP

**Health Check Endpoint:**
```typescript
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    memory: process.memoryUsage()
  });
});
```

### 6. Enhanced Debug Script (`debug-frontend.js`)

**New Monitoring Features:**
- Real-time request tracking with duplicate detection
- Rate limit monitoring and warnings
- Request pattern analysis
- Automatic monitoring with alerts for high frequency requests
- Comprehensive debugging functions

**Debug Functions Available:**
```javascript
window.debugRequests.analyzePattern() // Analyze feed request patterns
window.debugRequests.getDuplicates()  // Find duplicate requests
window.debugRequests.getHighFrequency() // Find high frequency requests
window.debugRequests.getFeedRequests() // Get all feed requests
```

## Expected Results

### Immediate Improvements:
1. **Reduced Server Load**: Rate limiting and request deduplication will significantly reduce backend load
2. **Better Error Handling**: Exponential backoff prevents request storms when server is down
3. **Improved User Experience**: Cached responses and better error handling provide smoother UX
4. **CORS Issues Resolved**: Enhanced CORS configuration handles production deployment properly

### Performance Metrics:
- **Feed Requests**: Reduced from potentially unlimited to max 20/minute per user
- **Request Deduplication**: Eliminates duplicate requests within 30-second windows
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Improved with 30-second cache duration for feed data
- **Error Recovery**: Exponential backoff prevents server overload during outages

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Production Monitoring:
1. Use the health check endpoint: `GET /health`
2. Monitor rate limit headers in responses
3. Check server logs for rate limit violations
4. Monitor memory usage and uptime via health endpoint

### Development Debugging:
1. Load `debug-frontend.js` in browser console
2. Use `window.debugRequests.analyzePattern()` to check request patterns
3. Monitor console for duplicate request warnings
4. Use `window.debugRequests.startMonitoring()` for automatic alerts

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables:
Ensure these are set correctly:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`: Should point to your backend (e.g., `https://linkdao-backend.onrender.com`)
- `NODE_ENV`: Should be `production` in production environment

### Backend Dependencies:
The backend already has `express-rate-limit` installed, so no additional packages needed.

### Frontend Changes:
All changes are backward compatible and don't require additional dependencies.

## Testing the Fix

1. **Deploy the changes** to both frontend and backend
2. **Monitor the health endpoint**: `curl https://linkdao-backend.onrender.com/health`
3. **Check browser console** for request patterns using the debug script
4. **Verify CORS**: Ensure requests from `https://linkdao.io` work properly
5. **Test rate limiting**: Try making many requests quickly to verify limits work

The combination of these changes should resolve both the excessive request issue and the CORS problems, providing a much more stable and performant application.
