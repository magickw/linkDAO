# Automated Event Handlers Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the Automated Event Handlers system for the marketplace messaging features. The system automatically processes order events and triggers appropriate messaging automation.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Order Event Handler Service
Located at: `app/backend/src/services/orderEventHandlerService.ts`

Key functionalities:
- **handleOrderEvent**: Processes specific order events (ORDER_CREATED, PAYMENT_RECEIVED, ORDER_SHIPPED, DISPUTE_INITIATED)
- **processPendingOrderEvents**: Processes pending order events

### 2. Order Event Listener Service
Located at: `app/backend/src/services/orderEventListenerService.ts`

Key functionalities:
- **startListening**: Starts automatic polling for new events (every 30 seconds)
- **stopListening**: Stops event polling
- **checkForNewEvents**: Checks database for new events and processes them
- **processOrderEvents**: Manually process all events for a specific order
- **processEventById**: Manually process a specific event by ID

### 3. Order Event Handler Controller & Routes
Located at:
- `app/backend/src/controllers/orderEventHandlerController.ts`
- `app/backend/src/routes/orderEventHandlerRoutes.ts`

API endpoints:
- **POST /api/order-events/handle**: Handle a specific order event
- **POST /api/order-events/process-pending**: Process pending order events

### 4. Integration with Existing Systems

The automated event handlers integrate with:
- **OrderMessagingAutomation**: Performs the actual messaging operations
- **DatabaseService**: Retrieves event data from the database
- **Main Application**: Automatically starts event listening when server starts

## Integration Points

### Route Registration
The order event handler routes are registered in `app/backend/src/index.ts`:
```typescript
import orderEventHandlerRoutes from './routes/orderEventHandlerRoutes';
app.use('/api/order-events', orderEventHandlerRoutes);
```

### Automatic Startup
The event listener is automatically started when the server starts:
```typescript
orderEventListenerService.startListening();
```

## Event Processing Flow

1. **Event Creation**: Order events are created in the database when order status changes
2. **Event Detection**: OrderEventListenerService polls for new events every 30 seconds
3. **Event Handling**: OrderEventHandlerService processes each event
4. **Messaging Automation**: OrderMessagingAutomation performs messaging operations
5. **Notification**: Users receive automated notifications via messaging system

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Located at: `app/backend/src/tests/orderEventHandler.test.ts`

Tests cover:
- Event handling for each supported event type
- Error handling for unknown event types
- Pending event processing functionality

### Integration Tests
Located at: `app/backend/src/tests/orderEventHandlerRoutes.test.ts`

Tests cover:
- Authentication requirements for API endpoints
- Input validation
- Successful request processing

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All API endpoints require user authentication
2. **Rate Limiting**: Applied to prevent abuse of event handling endpoints
3. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated before processing
4. **Error Handling**: Errors are logged but don't expose sensitive information

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Polling Interval**: 30-second interval balances responsiveness with resource usage
2. **Batch Processing**: Events are processed in batches for efficiency
3. **Error Isolation**: Individual event failures don't affect other events
4. **Database Indexes**: Events table is indexed for efficient querying

## Monitoring

The system provides monitoring through:
- Console logging of event processing activities
- Error tracking for failed event processing
- Performance metrics for event handling times

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Event Processing**: Replace polling with webhook or message queue integration
2. **Advanced Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for failed events
3. **Event Prioritization**: Prioritize critical events over informational ones
4. **Configuration Management**: Allow runtime configuration of event handling behavior
5. **Distributed Processing**: Scale event handling across multiple instances

## Deployment

The automated event handlers are ready for deployment with:
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Comprehensive error handling
- Proper logging and monitoring hooks
