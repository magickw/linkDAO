# Advanced Moderation Workflows System

## Overview

The Advanced Moderation Workflows system provides configurable, multi-stage moderation processes that can be customized for different content types and risk levels. This system enables automated and semi-automated moderation with flexible approval requirements and escalation paths.

## Features

### 1. Configurable Workflows
- **Multi-Stage Processing**: Define workflows with multiple sequential stages
- **Custom Criteria**: Set conditions for each stage based on content type, risk scores, user reputation, and flags
- **Flexible Actions**: Configure actions for each stage including allow, limit, block, review, and escalate
- **Role-Based Assignment**: Assign stages to specific moderator roles

### 2. Automated Moderation Rules
- **Rule-Based Automation**: Create rules that automatically trigger moderation actions
- **Priority System**: Prioritize rules for proper execution order
- **Conditional Logic**: Complex conditions based on content attributes and metadata
- **Auto-Execution**: Configure rules to execute automatically or require manual approval

### 3. Workflow Management
- **Workflow Creation**: Create new moderation workflows for specific use cases
- **Workflow Updates**: Modify existing workflows as community needs evolve
- **Workflow Activation**: Enable or disable workflows as needed
- **Version Control**: Track changes to workflows over time

### 4. Analytics and Reporting
- **Moderation Statistics**: Track key metrics including case volumes, resolution times, and action distributions
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor workflow effectiveness and efficiency
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns in moderation activity
- **Custom Reporting**: Generate detailed reports for community management

## Architecture

### Core Components
- `AdvancedModerationWorkflowsService`: Core service managing workflows and rules

## Default Workflows

### Standard Content Moderation
A general-purpose workflow for typical content moderation needs:
1. Initial AI Review - Automated review with risk threshold
2. Moderator Review - Human review for moderate-risk content
3. Escalated Review - Senior moderator review for high-risk content

### High-Risk Content Moderation
An enhanced workflow for content with elevated risk factors:
1. Immediate Flag - Automatic temporary limitation
2. Administrator Review - Direct admin review for critical content

## Default Rules

### Auto-Block Extreme Spam
Automatically blocks content identified as extreme spam with high confidence.

### Auto-Limit High-Risk Content
Automatically limits content with high risk scores for a defined period.

### Auto-Review Moderate-Risk Content
Flags moderate-risk content for human review with notifications.

## Implementation Details

### Workflow Processing
1. Content is analyzed using AI moderation services
2. Appropriate workflow is selected based on risk scores
3. Content progresses through workflow stages
4. Actions are executed automatically or await manual approval
5. Results are stored for analytics and reporting

### Rule Evaluation
1. Rules are evaluated in priority order
2. Conditions are checked against content attributes
3. Matching rules trigger configured actions
4. Actions are executed based on autoExecute setting

### Data Storage
Workflow data is stored in memory with:
- Workflow definitions with stages and criteria
- Rule definitions with conditions and actions
- Processing results for analytics
- Configuration settings

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient rule evaluation algorithms
- Caching for frequently accessed workflows
- Parallel processing where possible
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Workflow Features**
   - Parallel stage execution
   - Conditional branching
   - Time-based stage transitions
   - External system integrations

2. **Enhanced Rule Engine**
   - Complex boolean logic for conditions
   - Machine learning-based rule suggestions
   - A/B testing for rule effectiveness
   - Dynamic rule adjustment based on performance

3. **Collaboration Tools**
   - Moderator team management
   - Task assignment and tracking
   - Communication tools for moderation teams
   - Performance dashboards for moderators

4. **Integration Features**
   - Third-party workflow import/export
   - Plugin architecture for custom actions
   - Webhook support for external notifications
   - API marketplace for workflow sharing

## Usage Examples

### Create a Workflow
```javascript
const workflow = {
  name: "Community-Specific Moderation",
  description: "Custom workflow for community guidelines",
  isActive: true,
  stages: [
    {
      id: "community-review",
      name: "Community Moderator Review",
      order: 1,
      criteria: {
        contentType: ["post", "comment"],
        riskThreshold: 0.4,
        userReputationThreshold: 30,
        communityContext: ["gaming"],
        flagsRequired: 1
      },
      action: {
        type: "review",
        notificationRequired: true,
        autoExecute: false
      },
      requiredApprovals: 1,
      assignedRoles: ["community-moderator"]
    }
  ]
};

const result = await advancedModerationWorkflowsService.createWorkflow(workflow);
```

### Process Content
```javascript
const content = {
  id: "content-123",
  text: "This is a sample post content",
  userId: "user-456",
  type: "post"
};

const moderationCase = await advancedModerationWorkflowsService.processContent(content);
```

### Get Statistics
```javascript
const statistics = await advancedModerationWorkflowsService.getModerationStatistics('7d');
```

## Security Considerations

- All API endpoints are protected with authentication
- Admin-only access for workflow management functions
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization
- Role-based access control for workflow execution

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Health check endpoints for service monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Error logging and alerting
- Regular workflow optimization
- Rule effectiveness analysis
