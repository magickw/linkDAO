# Enhanced Escrow System Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy and integrate the enhanced escrow system with the existing LinkDAO marketplace.

## Overview

The enhanced escrow system consists of two main components:
1. **EnhancedEscrow.sol** - The smart contract implementing advanced escrow functionality
2. **EnhancedEscrowService** - The backend service that integrates with the smart contract

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- Hardhat
- Ethereum development environment

## Smart Contract Deployment

### 1. Compile the contracts

```bash
cd app/contracts
npm run build
```

### 2. Deploy the EnhancedEscrow contract

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-enhanced-escrow.ts --network <network-name>
```

### 3. Update environment variables

Add the following to your backend `.env` file:

```
ENHANCED_ESCROW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<deployed-contract-address>
```

## Backend Service Integration

The enhanced escrow service is automatically integrated with the marketplace controller. The new endpoints are:

- `POST /api/marketplace/enhanced-escrows` - Create enhanced escrow
- `POST /api/marketplace/enhanced-escrows/:escrowId/lock-funds` - Lock funds
- `POST /api/marketplace/enhanced-escrows/:escrowId/confirm-delivery` - Confirm delivery
- `POST /api/marketplace/enhanced-escrows/:escrowId/approve` - Approve escrow
- `POST /api/marketplace/enhanced-escrows/:escrowId/dispute` - Open dispute
- `POST /api/marketplace/enhanced-escrows/:escrowId/evidence` - Submit evidence
- `POST /api/marketplace/enhanced-escrows/:escrowId/vote` - Cast vote

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Smart Contract Development
- Actual escrow smart contracts that lock funds
- Integration with existing marketplace contracts

### 2. Automated Release Logic
- Automatic fund release when both parties approve
- Platform fee deduction

### 3. Delivery Tracking System
- Mechanisms for sellers to provide delivery information
- Delivery deadline enforcement

### 4. Reputation System Integration
- Automatic reputation point updates upon successful transactions
- Reputation-based voting power in dispute resolution

### 5. Enhanced Dispute System
- Community voting for dispute resolution
- Evidence submission system
- Arbitrator appointment mechanism

### 6. Notification System
- Event-based notifications for important escrow events
- Integration with backend notification system

## Testing

Run the enhanced escrow tests:

```bash
cd app/backend
npm run test src/tests/enhancedEscrowService.test.ts
```

## Integration with Frontend

The frontend can now use the new API endpoints to interact with the enhanced escrow system. The endpoints follow the same authentication patterns as the existing marketplace API.
