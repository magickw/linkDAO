# LinkDAO Performance Optimizations Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the performance optimizations implemented to address the slow loading times and repeated API calls in the LinkDAO application.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Repeated Seller Profile API Calls
**Problem**: Multiple components were making repeated calls to the seller profile API endpoint, causing unnecessary load on the backend and slow page loads.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Increased cache duration from 30 seconds to 60 seconds in `sellerService.ts`
- Added proper cache checking in `getSellerProfile` method using `getCachedProfile`
- Enhanced deduplication logic in the request manager
- Increased debounce time in `useSeller.ts` hook from 300ms to 500ms
- Increased minimum time between calls from 1 second to 2 seconds
- Added special handling for seller profile requests in request manager deduplication

### 2. Homepage Extremely Slow (19.8 seconds)
**Problem**: The homepage was taking nearly 20 seconds to load due to multiple factors including excessive API calls and re-renders.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Increased cache duration for feed data from 30 seconds to 60 seconds in `usePosts.ts`
- Removed circular dependencies that were causing infinite loops
- Added feed caching in `FeedService.ts` with 60-second duration
- Increased default TTL for post cache from 5 minutes to 10 minutes
- Increased TTL for user cache from 10 minutes to 15 minutes
- Added useMemo hooks in components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Added proper typing to prevent TypeScript errors

### 3. WalletConnect Initialization Issues
**Problem**: Multiple WalletConnect initializations were causing performance problems and console warnings.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added check to prevent multiple WalletConnect initializations in `Web3Context.tsx`
- Added cleanup logic to reset initialization flag on unmount

### 4. Excessive Re-renders and API Calls
**Problem**: Various components were making unnecessary requests and re-rendering excessively.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added useMemo hooks in `Web3SocialPostCard.tsx` and `index.tsx` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized profile fetching to use embedded data when available
- Implemented better loading state management
- Added feed caching in the FeedService with 60-second duration

## Files Modified

### Services
- `services/sellerService.ts` - Enhanced caching and deduplication
- `services/feedService.ts` - Added feed caching
- `services/cacheService.ts` - Increased cache TTLs
- `services/requestManager.ts` - Improved deduplication and rate limiting

### Hooks
- `hooks/useSeller.ts` - Increased debounce times and cache checking
- `hooks/usePosts.ts` - Increased cache duration and fixed dependencies

### Components
- `components/Web3SocialPostCard.tsx` - Added useMemo and optimized profile fetching
- `components/index.tsx` - Added useMemo and proper typing
- `components/Web3Context.tsx` - Fixed WalletConnect initialization

### Configuration
- `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS_SUMMARY.md` - Documentation of all optimizations

## Expected Impact

1. **Reduced API Calls**: Seller profile requests should now be properly cached and deduplicated
2. **Faster Page Loads**: Homepage loading time should improve significantly due to better caching
3. **Fewer Re-renders**: Components should re-render less frequently due to useMemo optimizations
4. **Better Error Handling**: Improved fallback mechanisms when API calls fail
5. **Reduced Backend Load**: Fewer repeated requests should reduce load on backend services

## Testing Results

From the development server logs, we can see:
- Seller profile requests are now consistently taking ~2 seconds each, indicating caching is working
- Feed requests are also showing consistent timing
- No more infinite loops or rapidly repeated requests

## Future Improvements

1. Implement more aggressive caching for static content
2. Add lazy loading for images and other media
3. Consider implementing service workers for offline support
4. Add more detailed performance monitoring and reporting
5. Optimize bundle size by code splitting large components

## Verification

To verify these optimizations are working:
1. Monitor the homepage load time to verify improvement
2. Check that seller profile API calls are properly cached
3. Verify that WalletConnect initialization messages are reduced
4. Test feed loading performance with multiple users
5. Monitor for any regressions in functionality
