**Key Features:**
- Batch evaluation of all active sellers every 24 hours
- Individual seller evaluation on demand
- Real-time WebSocket notifications for upgrades
- Comprehensive tier criteria with Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum tiers
- Intelligent caching with Redis for performance
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

#### AutomatedTierUpgradeController (`app/backend/src/controllers/automatedTierUpgradeController.ts`)

#### Routes (`app/backend/src/routes/automatedTierUpgradeRoutes.ts`)
- `/api/marketplace/seller/tier/progression/:walletAddress` - Get tier progression
- `/api/marketplace/seller/tier/evaluate` - Trigger manual evaluation
- `/api/marketplace/seller/tier/criteria` - Get tier criteria
- `/api/marketplace/seller/tier/statistics` - Get evaluation statistics
- `/api/marketplace/seller/tier/health` - Health check

### 2. Frontend Services

#### AutomatedTierUpgradeService (`app/frontend/src/services/automatedTierUpgradeService.ts`)
- Client-side service for tier upgrade functionality
- API integration with backend endpoints
- Data formatting and utility functions

#### useAutomatedTierUpgrade Hook (`app/frontend/src/hooks/useAutomatedTierUpgrade.ts`)
- React hook for tier upgrade functionality
- Real-time updates via WebSocket integration
- Caching with React Query
- Error handling and loading states

#### AutomatedTierUpgradePanel Component (`app/frontend/src/components/Seller/TierSystem/AutomatedTierUpgradePanel.tsx`)
- Visual component for displaying tier progression
- Progress bars and requirement tracking
- Manual evaluation triggers
- Notification display

### 3. Database Schema

#### Migration (`app/backend/drizzle/0047_automated_tier_upgrade_system.sql`)
- Added tier-related columns to sellers table
- Created tier evaluation history table
- Created tier upgrade notifications table
- Created tier criteria configuration table
- Created seller metrics cache table for performance
- Added indexes for optimal query performance
- Created database functions for metrics calculation

### 4. Integration Updates

#### Updated Services
- **SellerWebSocketService**: Added `sendTierUpgradeNotification` method
- **UnifiedSellerAPIClient**: Added automated tier upgrade endpoints
- **Backend Index**: Integrated new routes

#### Testing
- Comprehensive test suite (`app/backend/src/tests/automatedTierUpgradeService.test.ts`)
- Unit tests for tier criteria validation
- Integration test framework setup
- Error handling test coverage
