# Profile Page Fixes

This document outlines the issues identified and fixes implemented for the profile page errors.

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing Follow API Endpoints**: The backend was missing several follow-related endpoints that the frontend was trying to call:
   - `/api/follow/count/:address`
   - `/api/follow/followers/:address`
   - `/api/follow/following/:address`
   - `/api/follow/is-following/:follower/:following`
   - `/api/follow/follow`
   - `/api/follow/unfollow`

2. **Date Parsing Issues**: The backend was returning date strings, but the frontend UserProfile model expected Date objects.

3. **404 Errors**: The missing endpoints were causing 404 errors which were displayed as "Error loading profile" messages.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Backend Fixes

Added all missing follow API endpoints to `app/backend/src/index.production.js`:
- `/api/follow/count/:address` - Returns follower and following counts
- `/api/follow/followers/:address` - Returns list of followers
- `/api/follow/following/:address` - Returns list of following
- `/api/follow/is-following/:follower/:following` - Returns boolean follow status
- `/api/follow/follow` - Follow a user
- `/api/follow/unfollow` - Unfollow a user

These endpoints currently return mock data but can be connected to a database in the future.

### 2. Frontend Fixes

Updated `app/frontend/src/services/profileService.ts` to properly handle date conversion:
- Added date parsing logic to convert string dates from backend to Date objects
- Improved error handling for network issues
- Added better error messages for debugging

## Testing

After implementing these fixes, the profile page should now:
1. Load without the "Error loading profile" message
2. Display the user's profile information correctly
3. Show follow counts and other profile data
4. Allow editing of profile information

## Next Steps

1. Connect the follow endpoints to a real database implementation
2. Add proper authentication and authorization to the follow endpoints
3. Implement real follower/following logic instead of mock data
4. Add caching for better performance
