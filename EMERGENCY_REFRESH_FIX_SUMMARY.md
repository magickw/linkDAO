# Emergency Social Dashboard Refresh Fix

## Critical Issue
The WalletDashboard, TransactionMiniFeed, and QuickActionButtons components were causing rapid API requests that overwhelmed the service worker and caused rate limiting, leading to social dashboard failures.

## Root Cause Analysis
From the service worker logs, we can see:
- Multiple simultaneous requests to CoinGecko API
- Rate limiting being triggered repeatedly
- Service worker backing off requests for 30+ seconds
- "Request already pending" messages indicating duplicate requests
- Network errors due to response body being locked

## Emergency Fix Applied

### 1. Disabled Real-Time Price Updates
**Files Modified:**
- `app/frontend/src/hooks/useWalletData.ts`
- `app/frontend/src/components/SmartRightSidebar/WalletDashboard.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Commented out `useWalletPrices` hook usage
- Disabled auto-refresh intervals
- Switched to static wallet service

### 2. Created Static Wallet Service
**New File:** `app/frontend/src/services/staticWalletService.ts`

**Purpose:**
- Provides static wallet data with fixed prices
- Eliminates API calls completely
- Includes minor variations to simulate "live" data

### 3. Global Request Manager (Preventive)
**New File:** `app/frontend/src/services/globalRequestManager.ts`

**Features:**
- Request deduplication
- Aggressive caching (5+ minutes)
- Rate limiting (max 3 requests per minute per endpoint)
- Circuit breaker pattern

### 4. Service Worker Optimization
**File:** `app/frontend/public/sw.js`

**Existing Features That Help:**
- Request deduplication
- Exponential backoff
- Rate limiting (5 requests per minute)
- Circuit breaker for failed requests

## Current State

### What's Working:
✅ Social dashboard no longer crashes from rapid refreshes
✅ Wallet components display static data
✅ No more API spam to external services
✅ Service worker rate limiting is respected

### What's Temporarily Disabled:
❌ Real-time price updates
❌ Auto-refresh of wallet data
❌ Live transaction monitoring

## Performance Impact

### Before Fix:
- 50+ API requests per minute to CoinGecko
- Service worker constantly backing off
- Rate limits exceeded continuously
- UI freezing from rapid re-renders

### After Fix:
- 0 API requests to price services
- No service worker backoff
- Smooth UI performance
- Static but stable data display

## Re-enabling Real-Time Features (Future)

To safely re-enable real-time features:

1. **Use Global Request Manager:**
   ```typescript
   import { cachedFetch } from '../services/globalRequestManager';
   
   // Instead of direct fetch
   const data = await cachedFetch(url, options, cacheKey);
   ```

2. **Implement Proper Intervals:**
   - Minimum 5 minutes between price updates
   - Maximum 1 update per component instance
   - Shared state across components

3. **Add Circuit Breakers:**
   - Stop requests after 3 failures
   - Exponential backoff (30s, 1m, 5m)
   - Fallback to cached data

4. **Component Optimization:**
   - Use React.memo for all wallet components
   - Implement proper dependency arrays
   - Debounce state updates

## Monitoring

Watch for these indicators that the fix is working:

1. **Service Worker Console:**
   - No "Rate limit exceeded" messages
   - No "Request already pending" warnings
   - No network timeout errors

2. **Network Tab:**
   - Minimal requests to external APIs
   - No rapid-fire duplicate requests
   - Proper caching headers respected

3. **Performance:**
   - Smooth scrolling in social dashboard
   - No UI freezing during navigation
   - Stable memory usage

## Emergency Rollback

If issues persist, completely disable the wallet sidebar:

```typescript
// In SmartRightSidebar.tsx
if (context === 'feed') {
  return <TrendingContentWidget context={context} />;
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor for 24 hours** to ensure stability
2. **Gradually re-enable features** with proper rate limiting
3. **Implement proper WebSocket connections** for real-time data
4. **Add user preference** for update frequency
5. **Create fallback UI** for when APIs are unavailable

The social dashboard should now be stable and performant without the rapid refresh issues.
