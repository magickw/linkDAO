# Security Remediation Status

## Current Status
As of the latest audit, there are **41 vulnerabilities** remaining in the LinkDAO application:

- 21 low severity
- 12 moderate severity
- 8 high severity

This is a significant improvement from the initial 57 vulnerabilities, with the critical vulnerability in Next.js having been resolved.

## Vulnerabilities Addressed
We have successfully addressed several critical and high severity vulnerabilities by updating key dependencies:

### Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed
- **Next.js** - Updated to v15.5.6, eliminating a critical vulnerability that allowed Denial of Service (DoS) with Server Actions

### High Severity Vulnerabilities Fixed
- **jsonwebtoken** - Updated to v9.0.2, addressing signature validation bypass and other security issues
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts** - Updated to v5.0.0, addressing multiple high severity vulnerabilities
- **Hono** - Updated to v4.10.3, addressing Vary Header Injection leading to potential CORS Bypass

### Moderate Severity Vulnerabilities Fixed
- Multiple dependencies updated to address various security concerns

## Remaining Vulnerabilities

### No Available Fixes
The following vulnerabilities remain because no fixes are currently available from the package maintainers:

1. **@uniswap packages** - Multiple vulnerabilities in @uniswap/v3-periphery, @uniswap/smart-order-router, and @uniswap/v3-sdk that depend on vulnerable @openzeppelin/contracts versions

2. **WalletConnect/Reown ecosystem** - Multiple vulnerabilities in the @reown/appkit ecosystem and related @walletconnect packages

3. **IPFS related** - Issues with nanoid and parse-duration dependencies affecting ipfs-http-client

4. **TMP package** - Allows arbitrary temporary file/directory write via symbolic link

## Next Steps

### Monitoring
- Continue monitoring npm for updates to vulnerable packages
- Set up automated vulnerability monitoring for all dependencies

### Mitigation
- Implement additional security layers in the application to mitigate risks from vulnerable dependencies
- Consider alternative libraries for critical components where no fixes are available

### Process Improvements
- Establish a regular schedule for running npm audit and addressing vulnerabilities
- Implement a dependency management policy for evaluating new packages for security
- Add comprehensive security testing including penetration testing and static analysis

## Verification Commands
To verify the current status, you can run:

```bash
cd /Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app
npm audit
```
