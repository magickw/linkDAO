# Order Service Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Frontend Order Service
- Created `/app/frontend/src/services/orderService.ts` to handle all order-related API calls
- Implemented methods to fetch orders, get order details, track orders, confirm delivery, release funds, and open disputes
- Added proper type definitions and transformations between backend and frontend data structures

### 2. Updated Orders Page
- Replaced mock data with real API calls to the order service
- Integrated with wagmi to get the user's wallet address for fetching their orders
- Updated order status handling to match the backend enum values
- Maintained all existing UI functionality while using real data

### 3. Updated Order Tracking Component
- Replaced mock data with real API calls to the order service
- Implemented proper order status tracking with real-time updates via polling
- Updated timeline rendering to use actual order events from the backend
- Maintained all existing UI functionality while using real data

## Key Features

### Order Service Methods
1. `getOrdersByUser(userAddress: string)` - Fetch all orders for a user
2. `getOrderById(orderId: string)` - Get details for a specific order
3. `getOrderTrackingStatus(orderId: string)` - Get tracking status with timeline
4. `confirmDelivery(orderId: string, deliveryInfo: any)` - Confirm order delivery
5. `releaseFunds(orderId: string)` - Release funds to seller
6. `openDispute(orderId: string, reason: string)` - Open dispute for an order

### Data Transformation
- Properly transforms backend order data to frontend format
- Maps order statuses, payment methods, and timeline events
- Handles date formatting and status icon mapping

### Real-time Updates
- Implements polling mechanism to refresh order status every 30 seconds
- Provides manual refresh button for immediate updates
- Shows loading states during API calls

## Verification

The implementation ensures that:
- Orders page now displays real user orders instead of mock data
- Order tracking page shows real order status and timeline events
- All order actions (confirm delivery, release funds, open dispute) work with real API calls
- Proper error handling for failed API requests
- Maintains all existing UI/UX functionality

## Testing

To verify these changes:
1. Navigate to the orders page (`/orders`)
2. Confirm that real orders are displayed (if user has any)
3. Click on an order to view its tracking details
4. Verify that the order timeline shows real events
5. Test order actions (if applicable to order status)
