# Frontend Request Optimization & CORS Fix

## Issues Identified

1. **Excessive Requests**: Service worker is retrying failed requests without proper backoff
2. **CORS Errors**: Backend server may be shutting down due to overload, causing CORS preflight failures
3. **No Request Deduplication**: Multiple components may be making simultaneous requests
4. **Service Worker Retry Logic**: Failed requests are being retried too aggressively

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Request Deduplication in Service Worker
### 2. Improved CORS Configuration
### 3. Request Rate Limiting in Frontend
### 4. Better Error Handling and Backoff Strategy
