# Performance Optimizations Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the performance optimizations implemented to address the slow loading times and repeated API calls in the LinkDAO application.

## Key Issues Addressed

1. **Repeated 404 calls to seller profile API** - These were causing unnecessary load on the backend
2. **Homepage extremely slow (19.8 seconds)** - Multiple factors contributed to this
3. **WalletConnect initialization issues** - Multiple initializations causing performance problems
4. **Excessive re-renders and API calls** - Various components were making unnecessary requests

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Seller Profile Caching Improvements
**Files Modified:** `services/sellerService.ts`, `hooks/useSeller.ts`

- Increased cache duration from 30 seconds to 60 seconds
- Added methods to check cache status and retrieve cached profiles without making requests
- Enhanced deduplication logic in the request manager
- Increased debounce time between requests from 300ms to 500ms
- Increased minimum time between calls from 1 second to 2 seconds

### 2. Feed Loading Optimizations
**Files Modified:** `hooks/usePosts.ts`, `services/feedService.ts`, `services/cacheService.ts`

- Increased cache duration from 30 seconds to 60 seconds
- Removed circular dependencies that were causing infinite loops
- Added feed caching in the FeedService with 60-second duration
- Increased default TTL for post cache from 5 minutes to 10 minutes
- Increased TTL for user cache from 10 minutes to 15 minutes

### 3. Component Performance Improvements
**Files Modified:** `components/Web3SocialPostCard.tsx`, `pages/index.tsx`

- Added useMemo hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized profile fetching to use embedded data when available
- Added proper typing to prevent TypeScript errors
- Implemented better loading state management

### 4. Request Management Enhancements
**Files Modified:** `services/requestManager.ts`

- Increased default timeout from 10s to 15s
- Reduced default retries from 2 to 1
- Increased retry delay from 1s to 2s
- Increased rate limit from 20 to 30 requests per minute
- Added special handling for seller profile requests to improve deduplication

### 5. WalletConnect Initialization Fix
**Files Modified:** `context/Web3Context.tsx`

- Added check to prevent multiple WalletConnect initializations
- Added cleanup logic to reset initialization flag on unmount

## Expected Impact

1. **Reduced API Calls:** Seller profile requests should now be properly cached and deduplicated
2. **Faster Page Loads:** Homepage loading time should improve significantly due to better caching
3. **Fewer Re-renders:** Components should re-render less frequently due to useMemo optimizations
4. **Better Error Handling:** Improved fallback mechanisms when API calls fail
5. **Reduced Backend Load:** Fewer repeated requests should reduce load on backend services

## Testing Recommendations

1. Monitor the homepage load time to verify improvement
2. Check that seller profile API calls are properly cached
3. Verify that WalletConnect initialization messages are reduced
4. Test feed loading performance with multiple users
5. Monitor for any regressions in functionality

## Future Improvements

1. Implement more aggressive caching for static content
2. Add lazy loading for images and other media
3. Consider implementing service workers for offline support
4. Add more detailed performance monitoring and reporting
5. Optimize bundle size by code splitting large components
