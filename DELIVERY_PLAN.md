- **Fees/latency spikes**: Multi-RPC fallback, L2 selection, batched operations
- **Security incidents**: Audits, bounties, limited upgradability with timelocks

### Business Risks
- **Regulatory shifts**: Geofence, partner for KYC/fiat, modularize custody
- **Cold start**: Seed with communities, grants, referral loops, interoperable identity

## 8. Success Metrics
