# Moderation Best Practices

This guide provides proven strategies and best practices for effective content moderation on the LinkDAO platform.

## üéØ Core Principles

### Consistency
- **Apply Rules Uniformly**: Treat similar cases the same way regardless of user status
- **Document Decisions**: Maintain clear records of reasoning for future reference
- **Follow Precedents**: Use previous decisions as guidance for similar cases
- **Regular Calibration**: Participate in team discussions to align on standards

### Fairness
- **Consider Context**: Look beyond the reported content to understand the situation
- **Assume Good Intent**: Give users the benefit of the doubt when appropriate
- **Proportional Response**: Match the severity of action to the violation
- **Appeal Process**: Ensure users have a fair way to contest decisions

### Transparency
- **Clear Communication**: Explain decisions in understandable terms
- **Policy References**: Cite specific guidelines when taking action
- **Educational Approach**: Help users understand how to comply with rules
- **Public Guidelines**: Keep community standards visible and accessible

## üîç Content Review Process

### Initial Assessment
1. **Read Completely**: Review the entire content, not just flagged portions
2. **Check Context**: Examine surrounding conversation and thread history
3. **Verify Reports**: Confirm that reports accurately describe the issue
4. **Consider Source**: Review reporter's history and potential motivations
5. **Note Patterns**: Look for repeated behavior or coordinated activity

### Decision Framework
```
1. Does this violate platform policies?
   ‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Proceed to severity assessment
   ‚îî‚îÄ No ‚Üí Approve content, consider reporter education

2. What is the severity level?
   ‚îú‚îÄ Minor ‚Üí Warning or content edit
   ‚îú‚îÄ Moderate ‚Üí Content removal or temporary restriction
   ‚îî‚îÄ Severe ‚Üí Account suspension or permanent ban

3. Is this a repeat offense?
   ‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Escalate penalty level
   ‚îî‚îÄ No ‚Üí Apply standard first-offense response

4. Are there mitigating factors?
   ‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Consider reduced penalty
   ‚îî‚îÄ No ‚Üí Apply standard penalty
```
