# AI Moderation Integration - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview

AI-powered content moderation has been successfully integrated into LinkDAO's post creation and feed display workflows. The system automatically scans all content for spam, toxicity, copyright violations, and policy violations before posts are published.

---

## 🚀 What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Integration

#### **Post Creation with Moderation** (`postService.ts`)
- ✅ All posts now run through AI moderation **before** being published
- ✅ Blocked content is rejected immediately with explanatory error message
- ✅ Limited content is published with restricted visibility
- ✅ Content under review is flagged for human moderation
- ✅ Moderation metadata (status, risk score, categories) stored with each post

**Moderation Actions:**
- `block` - Content rejected, not saved to database
- `review` - Post saved with `pending_review` status for human review
- `limit` - Post saved with reduced visibility (shadowban)
- `allow` - Post published normally

#### **Feed Filtering** (`feedService.ts`)
- ✅ Blocked content automatically excluded from all feeds
- ✅ Moderation status and warnings passed to frontend
- ✅ Risk scores available for additional filtering

#### **Content Reporting API**
New routes created in `/api/moderation/`:
- `POST /api/moderation/report` - Submit content report (rate-limited to 10 per 15 min)
- `GET /api/moderation/reports/pending` - Get pending reports (admin only)
- `GET /api/moderation/reports/content/:contentId` - Get reports for specific content (admin)
- `PUT /api/moderation/reports/:reportId` - Update report status (admin)

---

### 2. Frontend Components

#### **ModerationWarning Component** (`/components/Moderation/ModerationWarning.tsx`)
Visual warning banners for moderated content:
- 🔵 **Blue** - Content under review (pending_review)
- 🟡 **Yellow** - Potentially sensitive (limited)
- ⚪ **Gray** - General notices

Features:
- Status-based styling and icons
- Risk score display for high-risk content
- Accessible with proper ARIA labels
- Dark mode support

#### **ReportContentButton Component** (`/components/Moderation/ReportContentButton.tsx`)
User-friendly content reporting:
- Flag button on all posts
- Modal with 9 report categories (spam, harassment, hate speech, etc.)
- Optional details textarea for additional context
- Rate-limited to prevent abuse
- Success/error feedback with toast notifications
- Fully accessible with keyboard navigation

#### **EnhancedPostCard Integration**
The main post display component now includes:
- Moderation warning display
- Report button in post header
- Conditional rendering based on moderation status

---

### 3. Data Model Updates

#### **Post Interface** (`/models/Post.ts`)
New fields added:
```typescript
{
  moderationStatus?: 'active' | 'limited' | 'pending_review' | 'blocked';
  moderationWarning?: string | null;
  riskScore?: number; // 0.0 to 1.0
  moderationCategories?: string[]; // e.g., ['spam', 'toxicity']
}
```

## 🔍 How It Works

### Post Creation Flow

```
User submits post
    ↓
AI Moderation Scan (aiContentModerationService)
    ├─ Spam Detection (repetitive patterns, promotional content)
    ├─ Toxicity Detection (hate speech, harassment, violence)
    ├─ Content Policy (using AI risk scoring)
    └─ Copyright Detection (pattern matching)
    ↓
Moderation Decision
    ├─ BLOCK → Error returned, post not saved
    ├─ REVIEW → Post saved with pending_review status
    ├─ LIMIT → Post saved with limited visibility
    └─ ALLOW → Post published normally
    ↓
Database storage with moderation metadata
    ↓
Feed Display (with moderation filtering)
```

### Moderation Scoring

The AI moderation service performs 4 parallel checks:

1. **Spam Detection**
   - Checks for repetitive posting (2+ similar posts in 1 hour)
   - Detects promotional keywords ("buy now", "limited time", etc.)
   - Identifies bot behavior (10+ posts in 1 hour)

2. **Toxicity Detection**
   - Hate speech identification
   - Harassment and bullying
   - Violence and threats
   - Maps to severity categories

3. **Content Policy Enforcement**
   - Uses existing AI risk scoring service
   - Checks against community guidelines
   - Returns policy type and explanation

4. **Copyright Detection**
   - Pattern matching for © symbols
   - Brand name detection
   - Quoted content analysis

**Overall Risk Score** = MAX(spam, toxicity, policy, copyright risk scores)

**Decision Logic:**
- Risk > 0.8 → BLOCK
- Risk > 0.6 → LIMIT
- Risk > 0.4 → REVIEW
- Risk ≤ 0.4 → ALLOW

## 📊 User Experience

### For Regular Users

**Creating a Post:**
1. User writes post content
2. Submits post
3. If blocked: Error message explains why
4. If limited: Post published with yellow warning banner
5. If under review: Post published with blue "under review" banner
6. If approved: Post appears normally

**Viewing Feed:**
- Blocked content never appears
- Limited content shows with warning banner
- Pending review content shows with review notice
- Risk scores visible for transparency (if configured)

**Reporting Content:**
1. Click "Report" button on any post
2. Select reason from 9 categories
3. Optional: Add details
4. Submit (rate-limited to prevent abuse)
5. Confirmation message appears

### For Administrators

**Review Queue:**
- Access pending reports at `/api/moderation/reports/pending`
- See all reports for specific content
- Update report status (open → under_review → resolved/dismissed)
- View moderation scores and AI explanations

---

## 🔧 Configuration & Customization

### Adjusting Moderation Thresholds

Edit `/backend/src/services/aiContentModerationService.ts`:

```typescript
// Line 316-322: Adjust risk thresholds
let recommendedAction: 'allow' | 'limit' | 'block' | 'review' = 'allow';
if (overallRiskScore > 0.8) {  // BLOCK threshold
  recommendedAction = 'block';
} else if (overallRiskScore > 0.6) {  // LIMIT threshold
  recommendedAction = 'limit';
} else if (overallRiskScore > 0.4) {  // REVIEW threshold
  recommendedAction = 'review';
}
```

### Customizing Warning Messages

Edit moderation warnings in `postService.ts` (line 70-76):

```typescript
if (moderationReport.recommendedAction === 'review') {
  postStatus = 'pending_review';
  moderationWarning = 'Your custom message here';
}
```

### Adding New Report Categories

Edit `ReportContentButton.tsx` (line 15-24) to add categories:

```typescript
const REPORT_REASONS = [
  { value: 'spam', label: 'Spam', description: '...' },
  // Add new category here
  { value: 'new_category', label: 'New Category', description: '...' }
];
```

---

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

### Logging

All moderation events are logged:
```typescript
console.log(`[MODERATION] Post ${post.id} created with status: ${postStatus}, risk: ${riskScore}`);
console.log(`[MODERATION] Content report submitted: ${reportId} - ${reason}`);
```

### Recommended Metrics to Track

1. **Moderation Decision Distribution**
   - % blocked
   - % limited
   - % under review
   - % allowed

2. **False Positive Rate**
   - Track admin overrides
   - User appeal success rate

3. **Response Time**
   - Time from report to review
   - Time from review to resolution

4. **Top Violation Categories**
   - Most common report reasons
   - Most common AI-detected violations

### Adding Metrics (Future Enhancement)

```typescript
// Example with Prometheus/DataDog
metrics.increment('moderation.decisions', {
  decision: 'block',
  category: 'spam'
});
metrics.histogram('moderation.latency', latencyMs);
metrics.gauge('moderation.queue_depth', queueDepth);
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

**Post Creation:**
- [ ] Submit normal post → should be published instantly
- [ ] Submit post with spam keywords → should be limited/blocked
- [ ] Submit post with offensive content → should be blocked
- [ ] Submit 10 posts rapidly → should be flagged as bot behavior

**Feed Display:**
- [ ] Verify blocked posts don't appear in feed
- [ ] Verify limited posts show yellow warning
- [ ] Verify pending review posts show blue banner
- [ ] Verify risk scores display correctly (if enabled)

**Content Reporting:**
- [ ] Click report button → modal opens
- [ ] Submit report without reason → error shown
- [ ] Submit valid report → success message
- [ ] Try submitting 11 reports in 15 min → rate limit error

**Admin Functions:**
- [ ] View pending reports
- [ ] Filter reports by status
- [ ] Update report status
- [ ] View all reports for specific content

### Test Content

**Should be BLOCKED:**
```
"Buy now! Limited time offer! Act fast! Exclusive deal! Money back guarantee!"
(Too many promotional keywords)
```

**Should be LIMITED:**
```
"You're an idiot and nobody likes you"
(Mild harassment/toxicity)
```

**Should be ALLOWED:**
```
"Just launched my new DAO project! Check it out at..."
(Promotional but not spammy)
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Implemented Protections

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Report submissions: 10 per 15 minutes
   - Prevents report spam/abuse

2. **Authentication Required**
   - All report endpoints require authentication
   - Admin routes protected with admin middleware

3. **Input Validation**
   - Zod schemas validate all inputs
   - SQL injection protection via ORM (Drizzle)

4. **Audit Trail**
   - All moderation decisions logged
   - Report submissions timestamped
   - Status changes tracked

### Recommendations

1. **Content Fingerprinting** - Track hashes to detect reposted violating content
2. **IP-Based Rate Limiting** - Add IP limits in addition to user limits
3. **Appeal System** - Build workflow for users to appeal moderation decisions
4. **Webhook Signatures** - Verify callbacks from AI services
5. **CAPTCHA** - Add to post submission to prevent bot spam
