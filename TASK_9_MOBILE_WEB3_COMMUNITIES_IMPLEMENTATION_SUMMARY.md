#### Web3 State Management
Added mobile-specific Web3 state:
```typescript
const [walletConnected, setWalletConnected] = useState(false);
const [userBalance, setUserBalance] = useState(1250);
const [stakingRewards, setStakingRewards] = useState(45);
const [governanceNotifications, setGovernanceNotifications] = useState(3);
```

#### Mobile Web3 Interaction Handlers
