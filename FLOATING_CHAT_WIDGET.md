The floating chat widget has been tested across multiple devices and browsers:
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari (desktop and mobile)
- iOS and Android mobile devices
- Various screen sizes and resolutions
- Keyboard navigation and screen readers

## Deployment

The floating chat widget is now live and available to all connected users. No additional setup is required.
