## Database Schema

### Core Tables Utilized:
1. **posts**: Primary content storage
2. **reactions**: User engagement with content
3. **views**: Content viewing tracking
4. **shares**: Content sharing events
5. **bookmarks**: Content saving events
6. **users**: Content creator information
7. **communities**: Community context for content

### Key Fields in posts:
- `id`: Unique post identifier
- `author_id`: Content creator reference
- `title`: Post title
- `content_cid`: IPFS content identifier
- `community_id`: Community association
- `tags`: Content categorization
- `is_token_gated`: Token access control
- `created_at`: Publication timestamp

### Key Fields in engagement tables:
- `post_id`: Reference to content
- `user_id`: Engaging user
- `created_at`: Timestamp of engagement
- `type`: Type of engagement (for reactions)
- `target_type`: Sharing destination (for shares)

## API Endpoints

### Content Performance Metrics:
- `GET /api/content-performance/posts/:postId` - Get performance metrics for a specific post
