# Comprehensive Smart Contract Test Suite

This directory contains a comprehensive testing framework for all smart contracts in the LinkDAO ecosystem. The test suite is designed to achieve >90% code coverage and includes unit tests, integration tests, security tests, and gas optimization benchmarks.

## Test Structure

### 1. TestSuite.ts
Core test infrastructure that:
- Deploys all contracts in the correct dependency order
- Configures contract interconnections
- Sets up test accounts and token distributions
- Provides utilities for gas reporting

### 2. UnitTests.test.ts
Comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Individual contract functionality
- All public functions
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Input validation
- State transitions

### 3. IntegrationTests.test.ts
Cross-contract workflow tests including:
- End-to-end marketplace transactions
- Governance proposal workflows
- NFT creation and trading
- Social features integration
- Payment processing flows

### 4. SecurityTests.test.ts
Security-focused tests covering:
- Reentrancy attack prevention
- Access control verification
- Integer overflow/underflow protection
- Input validation
- Front-running protection
- Emergency mechanisms

### 5. GasOptimizationTests.test.ts
Performance and gas usage tests:
- Gas benchmarks for all major operations
- Batch operation efficiency
- Storage optimization verification
- Performance recommendations

### 6. BasicTestSuite.test.ts
Simplified test suite for quick verification:
- Basic contract deployment
- Core functionality tests
- Essential security checks
- Gas usage measurements

## Running Tests

### Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run security tests
npm run test:security

# Run gas optimization tests
npm run test:gas-optimization

# Run basic test suite
npx hardhat test test/comprehensive/BasicTestSuite.test.ts
```

### Comprehensive Test Suite
```bash
# Run all tests with reporting
npm run test:comprehensive

# Run test runner with analysis
npm run test:runner
```

### Coverage Analysis
```bash
# Generate coverage report
npm run coverage

# Check coverage meets 90% threshold
npm run coverage:check
```

### Static Analysis
```bash
# Run Solidity linting
npm run lint

# Run static analysis (requires Slither)
npm run analyze
```

## Test Configuration

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 90% line coverage
- Minimum 90% function coverage
- Minimum 90% branch coverage
- Minimum 90% statement coverage

### Gas Benchmarks
Target gas usage for common operations:
- Token transfer: <100k gas
- Staking: <200k gas
- Marketplace listing: <200k gas
- Item purchase: <300k gas
- Escrow creation: <250k gas
- NFT minting: <200k gas
- Governance voting: <150k gas

### Security Checks
- Reentrancy protection
- Access control enforcement
- Input validation
- Integer overflow protection
- Emergency pause mechanisms
- Signature replay prevention

## Test Reports

The test suite generates several reports:

### 1. Coverage Report
- HTML report: `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`
- JSON summary: `coverage/coverage-summary.json`

### 2. Gas Report
- Detailed gas usage: `gas-report.txt`
- Gas benchmarks in test output

### 3. Test Report
- Comprehensive results: `test-report.json`
- Includes recommendations and analysis

### 4. Security Analysis
- Slither report: `slither-report.json` (if available)
- Security test results in main report

## Contract Interconnections

The test suite verifies proper configuration of contract dependencies:

```
LDAOToken → Governance, ReputationSystem, TipRouter, RewardPool
Governance → DisputeResolution
ReputationSystem → DisputeResolution, EnhancedEscrow
ProfileRegistry → FollowModule
PaymentRouter → Marketplace
EnhancedEscrow → Marketplace
DisputeResolution → (standalone)
Marketplace → (uses Escrow, PaymentRouter)
NFTMarketplace → NFTCollectionFactory
```

## Requirements Coverage

The test suite ensures all requirements from the specification are covered:

### Requirement 6.1 - Unit Tests
✅ All contract functions tested
✅ Edge cases covered
✅ Error conditions verified

### Requirement 6.2 - Integration Tests
✅ Cross-contract workflows tested
✅ End-to-end scenarios covered
✅ Event emission verified

### Requirement 6.3 - Security Tests
✅ Common vulnerabilities tested
✅ Access control verified
✅ Attack vectors covered

### Requirement 6.4 - Test Coverage
✅ 90% minimum coverage target
✅ Comprehensive function coverage
✅ Branch and statement coverage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Hardhat compilation errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check Solidity version compatibility
   - Verify contract imports

2. **Test failures**
   - Check contract deployment order
   - Verify account setup
   - Ensure proper gas limits

3. **Coverage issues**
   - Review uncovered code paths
   - Add tests for missing functions
   - Check branch coverage

### Environment Setup

Ensure the following are installed:
- Node.js 16+
- Hardhat
- TypeScript
- Solidity compiler
- Slither (optional, for static analysis)

### Running in CI/CD

The test suite is designed to run in continuous integration:
- All tests must pass
- Coverage must meet 90% threshold
- Gas usage must be within limits
- Security tests must pass

## Contributing

When adding new contracts or features:

1. Add unit tests for all new functions
2. Add integration tests for cross-contract interactions
3. Add security tests for new attack vectors
4. Update gas benchmarks
5. Ensure coverage remains >90%
6. Update this documentation

## Next Steps

After implementing the comprehensive test suite:

1. Run full test suite and achieve 90% coverage
2. Address any security findings
3. Optimize gas usage based on benchmarks
4. Prepare for external security audit
5. Deploy to testnet for final verification
