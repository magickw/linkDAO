## Critical Findings

**None at this time**

## High Priority Findings

**None at this time**

## Medium Priority Findings

1. **Test Coverage** - Some comprehensive tests are failing and need to be fixed
2. **Function Visibility** - Some setter functions may need to be added for better contract interconnection

## Low Priority Findings

1. **Documentation** - Some functions could benefit from more detailed NatSpec comments
2. **Gas Optimization** - Minor gas savings possible in batch operations

## Recommended Actions Before Mainnet

### Critical (Must Complete)
- [ ] Complete external third-party security audit
- [ ] Fix all critical and high-priority findings
- [ ] Achieve 100% test coverage on critical contracts
- [ ] Implement comprehensive integration tests
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting infrastructure

### High Priority (Strongly Recommended)
- [ ] Complete formal verification of critical functions
- [ ] Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Conduct penetration testing
- [ ] Review and update emergency procedures
- [ ] Complete bug bounty program setup

### Medium Priority (Recommended)
- [ ] Optimize gas usage in high-frequency functions
- [ ] Enhance NatSpec documentation
- [ ] Implement additional access control tests
- [ ] Set up contract upgrade procedures
- [ ] Create incident response playbook

## Audit Guidelines

### For External Auditors

1. **Scope**: Review all contracts in `/contracts` directory
2. **Focus Areas**:
   - Access control and permissions
   - Reentrancy vulnerabilities
   - Integer overflow/underflow
   - Front-running risks
   - Gas optimization opportunities
   - Logic errors and edge cases

3. **Deliverables**:
   - Detailed audit report (PDF and Markdown)
   - Severity classification of findings
   - Remediation recommendations
   - Re-audit after fixes

### For Internal Reviewers

1. **Process**:
   - Review code changes before merge
   - Document findings in `internal/` directory
   - Track remediation in GitHub issues
   - Update this README with findings

2. **Template**: Use `templates/internal-review-template.md`
