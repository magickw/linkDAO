# Smart Contract Upgrade Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the procedures for safely upgrading smart contracts in the Web3 marketplace ecosystem. The system uses UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern with governance controls and timelock mechanisms.

## Upgrade Architecture

### Proxy Pattern
- **UUPS Proxy**: Upgradeable contracts use OpenZeppelin's UUPS proxy pattern
- **Implementation Storage**: Logic is stored in implementation contracts
- **State Preservation**: Proxy maintains state across upgrades
- **Address Consistency**: Proxy address remains constant

### Governance Control
- **Timelock Mechanism**: 24-hour minimum delay for upgrades
- **Multi-signature**: Critical upgrades require multiple approvals
- **Community Voting**: Major upgrades go through DAO governance
- **Emergency Procedures**: Fast-track upgrades for security issues

## Upgrade Types

### 1. Minor Upgrades
- **Definition**: Bug fixes, gas optimizations, minor feature additions
- **Approval**: Owner or multisig approval
- **Timelock**: 24 hours minimum
- **Testing**: Automated test suite must pass

### 2. Major Upgrades
- **Definition**: New features, significant changes, breaking changes
- **Approval**: DAO governance vote required
- **Timelock**: 7 days minimum
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing including security audit

### 3. Emergency Upgrades
- **Definition**: Critical security fixes
- **Approval**: Emergency multisig (3/5 signatures)
- **Timelock**: Can be bypassed in emergency mode
- **Testing**: Minimal testing, immediate deployment

## Upgrade Process

### Phase 1: Preparation
1. **Code Development**
   - Implement changes in new contract version
   - Ensure storage layout compatibility
   - Add comprehensive tests

2. **Testing**
   ```bash
   # Run upgrade tests
   npx hardhat test test/upgrades/
   
   # Validate upgrade compatibility
   npx hardhat run scripts/validate-upgrade.ts
   ```

3. **Security Review**
   - Internal code review
   - Automated security analysis
   - External audit for major changes

### Phase 2: Proposal
1. **Deploy New Implementation**
   ```bash
   # Deploy new implementation
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-implementation.ts --network sepolia
   ```

2. **Create Upgrade Proposal**
   ```bash
   # Propose upgrade
   npx hardhat run scripts/upgrade-manager.ts -- propose ContractName ProxyAddress
   ```

3. **Community Review**
   - Publish upgrade proposal
   - Allow community feedback period
   - Address concerns and questions

### Phase 3: Voting (Major Upgrades)
1. **Start Governance Vote**
   ```bash
   # Start DAO vote
   npx hardhat run scripts/start-governance-vote.ts
   ```

2. **Voting Period**
   - 7-day voting period
   - Minimum 20% quorum required
   - Simple majority for approval

3. **Vote Execution**
   ```bash
   # Execute successful vote
   npx hardhat run scripts/execute-governance-vote.ts
   ```

### Phase 4: Execution
1. **Timelock Wait**
   - Wait for timelock period to expire
   - Monitor for any issues or concerns

2. **Execute Upgrade**
   ```bash
   # Execute upgrade
   npx hardhat run scripts/upgrade-manager.ts -- execute ProxyAddress
   ```

3. **Verification**
   ```bash
   # Verify upgrade success
   npx hardhat run scripts/verify-upgrade.ts
   ```

### Phase 5: Post-Upgrade
1. **Functionality Testing**
   - Test all major functions
   - Verify state preservation
   - Check event emissions

2. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor contract behavior
   - Watch for unexpected issues
   - Track gas usage changes

3. **Documentation Update**
   - Update contract documentation
   - Record upgrade in history
   - Notify stakeholders

## Rollback Procedures

### When to Rollback
- Critical bugs discovered post-upgrade
- Unexpected behavior or failures
- Security vulnerabilities introduced
- Community consensus for rollback

### Rollback Process
1. **Emergency Assessment**
   ```bash
   # Assess situation
   npx hardhat run scripts/emergency-assessment.ts
   ```

2. **Pause Operations**
   ```bash
   # Pause affected contracts
   npx hardhat run scripts/emergency-procedures.ts -- pause
   ```

3. **Execute Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Rollback to previous version
   npx hardhat run scripts/upgrade-manager.ts -- rollback ContractName ProxyAddress 1.0.0
   ```

4. **Verify Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Verify rollback success
   npx hardhat run scripts/verify-rollback.ts
   ```

5. **Resume Operations**
   ```bash
   # Unpause contracts
   npx hardhat run scripts/emergency-procedures.ts -- unpause
   ```

## Storage Layout Management

### Storage Compatibility Rules
1. **Never remove variables** from previous versions
2. **Never change variable types** in existing slots
3. **Never reorder variables** in storage
4. **Always append new variables** at the end
5. **Use storage gaps** for future expansion

### Storage Gap Pattern
```solidity
contract MyUpgradeableContract {
    // Existing variables
    uint256 public value1;
    address public owner;
    
    // Storage gap for future variables
    uint256[48] private __gap;
}
```

### Storage Layout Validation
```bash
# Check storage layout compatibility
npx hardhat run scripts/validate-storage-layout.ts
```

## Security Considerations

### Pre-Upgrade Security
- **Code Review**: Multiple developers review changes
- **Automated Analysis**: Slither, MythX, and other tools
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 95% test coverage
- **Audit**: External audit for major changes

### Upgrade Security
- **Timelock**: Prevents immediate malicious upgrades
- **Multi-signature**: Requires multiple approvals
- **Governance**: Community oversight for major changes
- **Emergency Pause**: Ability to halt operations
