# Contract Emergency Pause Runbook

## Alert Description
This alert triggers when a smart contract has been emergency paused, indicating a critical security or operational issue.

## Severity: CRITICAL

## Immediate Actions (0-2 minutes)

### 1. Acknowledge the Alert
- Confirm which contract(s) have been paused
- Identify who triggered the pause (if available)
- Check if this was a planned maintenance or emergency action

### 2. Assess Impact
- Determine user impact and affected functionality
- Check if other contracts are still operational
- Verify if user funds are secure

### 3. Emergency Communication
```bash
# Send immediate notification to all stakeholders
curl -X POST [SLACK_WEBHOOK] -d '{
  "text": "ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Contract [CONTRACT_NAME] has been emergency paused",
  "channel": "#incidents"
}'
```

## Investigation Steps (2-15 minutes)

### 1. Determine Pause Reason
```solidity
// Check pause event logs
contract.getPauseReason() // If implemented
contract.pausedBy() // Who paused the contract
contract.pauseTimestamp() // When it was paused
```

### 2. Review Recent Activity
- Check recent transactions for suspicious activity
- Review monitoring alerts that preceded the pause
- Analyze any security alerts or anomalies

### 3. Verify Contract State
```bash
# Check contract balance and critical state
cast call [CONTRACT_ADDRESS] "paused()" --rpc-url [RPC_URL]
cast call [CONTRACT_ADDRESS] "owner()" --rpc-url [RPC_URL]
cast balance [CONTRACT_ADDRESS] --rpc-url [RPC_URL]
```

## Security Assessment

### 1. Check for Attack Indicators
- Unusual transaction patterns
- Large value transfers
- Multiple failed transactions
- Governance attacks
- Oracle manipulation

### 2. Verify Contract Integrity
- Confirm contract code hasn't been upgraded maliciously
- Check if ownership has been transferred
- Verify critical parameters haven't been changed

### 3. External Threat Analysis
- Check security feeds for known exploits
- Review similar contracts for vulnerabilities
- Analyze transaction patterns for MEV attacks

## Resolution Process

### 1. If Pause was Justified (Security Issue)
1. **DO NOT UNPAUSE** until security review is complete
2. Engage security team immediately
3. Prepare incident response plan
4. Consider external security audit

### 2. If Pause was False Positive
1. Verify the trigger condition is resolved
2. Get approval from at least 2 senior engineers
3. Prepare unpause transaction
4. Monitor closely after unpausing

### 3. Unpausing Procedure
```solidity
// Multi-sig unpause process
1. Prepare unpause transaction
2. Get required signatures
3. Execute unpause
4. Verify contract functionality
5. Monitor for 1 hour minimum
```

## Communication Plan

### 1. Internal Communication
- Notify all engineering team members
- Update incident management system
- Brief executive team if significant impact

### 2. External Communication
- Update status page immediately
- Prepare user communication
- Notify partners and integrators
- Consider public disclosure if security issue

### 3. Regulatory Considerations
- Assess if incident requires regulatory reporting
- Prepare compliance documentation
- Consider legal implications

## Post-Incident Actions

### 1. Immediate (0-24 hours)
- Conduct hot wash meeting
- Document timeline and actions taken
- Implement additional monitoring if needed
- Update runbooks based on learnings

### 2. Short-term (1-7 days)
- Complete detailed incident report
- Review and update pause mechanisms
- Enhance monitoring and alerting
- Conduct security review

### 3. Long-term (1-4 weeks)
- Implement preventive measures
- Update emergency procedures
- Conduct team training
- Consider architectural improvements

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Enhanced Monitoring
- Implement predictive security alerts
- Add anomaly detection for unusual patterns
- Monitor external threat intelligence
- Set up automated circuit breakers

### 2. Security Hardening
- Regular security audits
- Implement time delays for critical functions
- Add multi-signature requirements
- Enhance access controls

### 3. Operational Excellence
- Regular disaster recovery drills
- Update incident response procedures
- Maintain current security patches
- Continuous security training
