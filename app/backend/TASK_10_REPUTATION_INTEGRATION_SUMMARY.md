### 4. Reputation Restoration for Successful Appeals
- **Restoration Amount**: 75% of original penalty restored
- **Appeal Bonus**: Additional 50 points for successful appeal
- **Counter Updates**: Successful appeals count tracked
- **Audit Trail**: Full audit trail of restoration events

### 5. Juror Performance Tracking and Reputation Updates
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Track correct vs incorrect jury decisions
- **Reward System**: Rewards for accurate decisions with time bonuses
- **Penalty System**: Stake slashing for incorrect decisions (10%)
- **Eligibility Requirements**: Minimum reputation (1500) and accuracy (70%) for jury duty
- **Performance Metrics**: Quality scores and response time tracking

## Calculation Logic Verified

### Reporting Weight Calculations
- **Low Reputation** (< 500): 0.5x weight
- **Medium Reputation** (500-1499): 1.0x weight  
- **High Reputation** (≥ 1500): 1.5x weight

### Violation Penalty Calculations
- **Base Penalties**: By severity level
- **Escalation**: 1 + (violationCount * 0.2), capped at 3x
- **Progressive Penalties**: Automatic penalty application based on violation count

### Moderation Strictness Adjustments
- **Low Reputation** (0-500): 2.0x strictness
- **Medium Reputation** (500-1000): 1.5x strictness
- **Good Reputation** (1000-2000): 1.0x strictness
- **High Reputation** (≥ 2000): 0.8x strictness
