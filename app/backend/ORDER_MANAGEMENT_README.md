## Usage Examples

### Creating an Order
```typescript
const orderInput = {
  listingId: '1',
  buyerAddress: '0x1234...',
  sellerAddress: '0x5678...',
  amount: '1000',
  paymentToken: '0xA0b8...',
  shippingAddress: {
    name: 'John Doe',
    street: '123 Main St',
    city: 'Anytown',
    state: 'CA',
    postalCode: '12345',
    country: 'US'
  }
};

const order = await orderService.createOrder(orderInput);
```

### Processing Shipping
```typescript
const shippingInfo = {
  carrier: 'FEDEX',
  service: 'GROUND',
  fromAddress: sellerAddress,
  packageInfo: {
    weight: 2.5,
    dimensions: { length: 10, width: 8, height: 6 },
    value: '1000',
    description: 'Product description'
  }
};

await orderService.processShipping(orderId, shippingInfo);
```

### Tracking Shipment
```typescript
const trackingInfo = await shippingService.trackShipment(
  'TRACK123456789', 
  'FEDEX'
);
console.log(trackingInfo.status); // 'In Transit'
console.log(trackingInfo.events); // Array of tracking events
```

### Initiating Dispute
```typescript
await orderService.initiateDispute(
  orderId,
  buyerAddress,
  'Product not as described',
  ['https://ipfs.io/evidence1.jpg', 'https://ipfs.io/evidence2.jpg']
);
```
