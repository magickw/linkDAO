# Heroicons Import Error Fix Summary

## Issue
The Vercel build was failing with the following error:
```
Type error: Module '"@heroicons/react/24/outline"' has no exported member 'TrendingUpIcon'.
```

## Root Cause
In Heroicons v2.2.0, the icon names were changed from `TrendingUpIcon` and `TrendingDownIcon` to `ArrowTrendingUpIcon` and `ArrowTrendingDownIcon`.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `/src/components/Admin/Analytics/CohortAnalysis/CohortAnalysisDashboard.tsx`
- Updated imports to use correct icon names:
  ```typescript
  import { 
    CalendarIcon, 
    ArrowPathIcon,
    UsersIcon,
    ArrowTrendingUpIcon,  // Changed from TrendingUpIcon
    ArrowTrendingDownIcon, // Changed from TrendingDownIcon
    ChartBarIcon
  } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
  ```
- Updated all references throughout the component to use the new icon names
- Fixed TypeScript type error with comparisonCohorts state

### 2. `/src/components/Admin/Analytics/CohortAnalysis/CohortHeatmap.tsx`
- Updated imports to use correct icon names
- Updated all references throughout the component to use the new icon names

### 3. `/src/components/Mobile/MobileWeb3DataDisplay.tsx`
- Updated imports to use correct icon names
- Updated all references throughout the component to use the new icon names

## Verification
- All references to `TrendingUpIcon` and `TrendingDownIcon` have been removed
- All imports now correctly reference `ArrowTrendingUpIcon` and `ArrowTrendingDownIcon`
- The specific TypeScript compilation error mentioned in the Vercel logs has been resolved

## Additional Fixes
- Installed missing `d3-sankey` package and its type definitions to resolve other build errors
- Fixed TypeScript type error in comparisonCohorts state handling

The Heroicons import error that was preventing successful Vercel deployments has been resolved.
