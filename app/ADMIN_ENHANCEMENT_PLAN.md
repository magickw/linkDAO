## Technical Architecture Recommendations

### 1. State Management
- **Recommendation**: Use Zustand or Redux Toolkit for global state
- **Benefits**: Centralized state, easier debugging, better performance
- **Migration**: Gradually migrate from local state to global state

### 2. API Layer
- **Recommendation**: Implement API client with React Query
- **Benefits**: Automatic caching, retry logic, loading states
- **Implementation**: Wrap adminService methods with React Query hooks

### 3. Real-Time Updates
- **Recommendation**: WebSocket with Socket.io or native WebSockets
- **Benefits**: Live updates without polling, better UX
- **Use Cases**: Moderation queue, user activity, system alerts

### 4. Caching Strategy
- **Recommendation**: Multi-layer caching (Redis + in-memory + browser)
- **Implementation**:
  - Redis for shared backend cache
  - In-memory cache for frequently accessed data
  - Browser localStorage for user preferences
  - React Query for API response caching

### 5. Database Optimization
- **Recommendation**: Add indexes, partitioning, and read replicas
- **Implementation**:
  - Index frequently queried columns
  - Partition large tables by date
  - Use read replicas for analytics queries

### 6. Security Hardening
- **Recommendation**: Multiple layers of security
- **Implementation**:
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
  - XSS protection (CSP headers, output encoding)
  - CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
  - Rate limiting per endpoint and user
  - IP allowlisting for admin access (optional)
