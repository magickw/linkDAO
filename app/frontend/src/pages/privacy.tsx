            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to LinkDAO's Privacy Policy. This policy describes how we collect, use, store, and 
              protect your information when you use our decentralized social platform. We are committed to 
              protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in our data practices.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              As a Web3 platform built on blockchain technology, LinkDAO operates differently from traditional 
              social networks. Much of the data you interact with is stored on public blockchains, which affects 
              how we handle privacy.
            </p>
