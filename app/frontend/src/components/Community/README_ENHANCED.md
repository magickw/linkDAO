## Overview

The enhanced community components address several key areas for improvement:

- **Styling Consistency**: Unified Tailwind CSS approach with consistent component patterns
- **Loading States**: Enhanced skeleton components that match actual content structure
- **Accessibility**: Improved keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and focus management
- **Performance**: Proper virtualization implementation with react-window for large feeds

## Components

### CommunityCardEnhanced

An enhanced version of the community card with improved styling and accessibility.

**Props:**
- `community`: Community data object
- `onSelect`: Callback when card is selected
- `onJoin`: Callback when join button is clicked

- `compact`: Whether to render in compact mode

**Features:**
- Consistent Tailwind styling
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Responsive design
- Loading states

### CommunityPostCardEnhanced

An enhanced version of the community post card with improved accessibility and interaction.

**Props:**
- `post`: Post data object
- `community`: Community data object
- `userMembership`: User membership information
- `onVote`: Callback for voting actions
- `onReaction`: Callback for reaction actions
- `onTip`: Callback for tipping actions
- `className`: Additional CSS classes

**Features:**
- Enhanced keyboard navigation
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Focus management
- Improved interaction controls
- Better visual hierarchy

### CommunityLoadingSkeletons

Loading skeleton components that match the actual content structure.

**Components:**
- `CommunityCardSkeleton`: Skeleton for community cards
- `CommunityFeedSkeleton`: Skeleton for community feeds

**Props:**
- `compact`: Whether to render in compact mode (for cards)
- `postCount`: Number of posts to show (for feeds)

## Enhancements

### Styling Consistency

All enhanced components use a consistent Tailwind CSS approach:

- Unified color palette
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Responsive design patterns
- Dark mode support
- Proper border and shadow styling

### Loading States

Enhanced skeleton components provide better loading experiences:

- Content-structured skeletons
- Proper animation timing
- Consistent styling with actual components
- Responsive design support

### Accessibility

Enhanced accessibility features include:

- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management
- Screen reader compatibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- Color contrast compliance

### Performance

Performance optimizations include:

- Virtualization for large feeds
- Memoization of expensive calculations
- Efficient re-rendering
- Lazy loading support
- Bundle size optimization

## Usage

### CommunityCardEnhanced

```tsx
import { CommunityCardEnhanced } from '@/components/Community';

<CommunityCardEnhanced
  community={communityData}
  onSelect={handleSelect}
  onJoin={handleJoin}
  showTrendingInfo={true}
  compact={false}
/>
```

### CommunityPostCardEnhanced

```tsx
import CommunityPostCardEnhanced from '@/components/Community/CommunityPostCardEnhanced';

<CommunityPostCardEnhanced
  post={postData}
  community={communityData}
  userMembership={membershipData}
  onVote={handleVote}
  onReaction={handleReaction}
  onTip={handleTip}
/>
```

### CommunityLoadingSkeletons

```tsx
import { CommunityCardSkeleton, CommunityFeedSkeleton } from '@/components/Community/CommunityLoadingSkeletons';

// For community cards
<CommunityCardSkeleton compact={false} />

// For community feeds
<CommunityFeedSkeleton postCount={5} />
```

## Testing

The enhanced components include comprehensive test coverage:

- Unit tests for component rendering
- Accessibility testing
- Interaction testing
- Responsive design testing

### Running Tests
