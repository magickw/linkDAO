# Charity Governance System

The LinkDAO Charity Governance system enables decentralized charitable giving through blockchain technology. This system allows community members to propose, vote on, and execute charitable donations while maintaining transparency and accountability.

## Overview

The charity governance system consists of several interconnected smart contracts that work together to facilitate charitable giving:

1. **CharityGovernance** - Main governance contract for creating and managing charity proposals
2. **CharityVerificationSystem** - System for verifying charitable organizations
3. **ProofOfDonationNFT** - NFT-based proof of donation system
4. **CharityProposal** - Contract for managing charity campaigns
5. **BurnToDonate** - Mechanism for burning tokens to trigger donations
6. **CharitySubDAOFactory** - Factory for creating regional charity SubDAOs
7. **BaseSubDAO** - Base implementation for regional charity SubDAOs

## Key Features

### Charity Proposals

Community members can create proposals to donate to verified charitable organizations. These proposals go through a voting process where LDAO token holders can vote to approve or reject the donation.

### Charity Verification

All charitable organizations must be verified before they can receive donations through the system. This verification process ensures that funds are directed to legitimate charitable causes.

### Proof of Donation NFTs

When a donation is made, donors receive a soulbound NFT that serves as proof of their contribution. These NFTs are non-transferable and serve as a permanent record of charitable giving.

### Burn-to-Donate Mechanism

Users can burn LDAO tokens to trigger donations from the treasury, creating a deflationary mechanism that benefits the entire ecosystem while supporting charitable causes.

### Regional SubDAOs

The system supports the creation of regional charity SubDAOs that can manage local charitable initiatives while remaining connected to the main DAO.

## How It Works

1. **Proposal Creation**: A community member creates a charity proposal specifying the recipient organization, donation amount, and impact metrics.

2. **Voting Period**: LDAO token holders vote on the proposal during a designated voting period.

3. **Execution**: If the proposal passes, it can be executed to transfer funds to the charitable organization.

4. **Verification**: After the donation is made, the transaction is verified and recorded on-chain.

5. **Proof of Donation**: Donors receive NFTs as proof of their contribution.
