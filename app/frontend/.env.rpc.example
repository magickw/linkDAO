# Add these to your frontend .env.local file for better RPC reliability:

# Infura API Key (get from https://infura.io)
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_key_here

# Alchemy API Key (get from https://alchemy.com)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_key_here

# These will eliminate the "JsonRpcProvider failed to detect network" errors
# by using premium RPC endpoints instead of rate-limited public ones
