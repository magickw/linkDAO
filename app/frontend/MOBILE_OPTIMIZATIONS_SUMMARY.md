- Hook functionality tests
- Touch gesture simulation tests
- Accessibility compliance tests
- Performance optimization tests

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end mobile workflows
- Cross-component interaction tests
- Gesture and touch event tests
- Responsive design tests

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Target Metrics (All Achieved)
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 2.5s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: < 0.1
- **First Input Delay**: < 100ms
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3.5s

### Optimization Techniques
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Image lazy loading with blur-to-sharp transitions
- Code splitting by route and feature
- Service worker caching
- Bundle size optimization

## 🔧 Browser Support

### Mobile Browsers
- **iOS Safari**: 14.0+
- **Android Chrome**: 90+
- **Samsung Internet**: 14.0+
- **Firefox Mobile**: 90+

### Features Used
- **CSS**: `env()` for safe areas, `backdrop-filter` for glassmorphism
- **JavaScript**: Touch events, Intersection Observer, ResizeObserver
- **APIs**: Vibration API, Visual Viewport API, matchMedia

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Basic Mobile Component Usage
```tsx
import { MobileEnhancedFeed, CreatePostFAB } from '@/components/Mobile';

<MobileEnhancedFeed
  posts={posts}
  onPostCreate={handlePostCreate}
  onPostReact={handlePostReact}
  // ... other handlers
/>

<CreatePostFAB
  onCreatePost={() => setShowComposer(true)}
  onCreatePoll={() => setShowPollCreator(true)}
/>
```

### Mobile Optimization Hooks
```tsx
import { useMobileOptimization, useMobileAccessibility } from '@/hooks';

const {
  isMobile,
  triggerHapticFeedback,
  safeAreaInsets,
  touchTargetClasses
} = useMobileOptimization();

const {
  announceToScreenReader,
  accessibilityClasses
} = useMobileAccessibility();
```
