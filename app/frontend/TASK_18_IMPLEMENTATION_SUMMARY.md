const mergedPreferences = {
  ...socialPrefs,
  ...web3SocialPrefs,
  migratedFrom: oldWeb3SocialPreferences ? 'web3-social-page' : 'social-page',

};
```

### 4. Migration Guide Component (`/components/MigrationGuide.tsx`)

## Migration Flow

### For Connected Users:
1. User visits `/social` or `/web3-social`
2. Migration logic detects wallet connection
3. Feed state is preserved in sessionStorage
4. User preferences are migrated to dashboard format
5. Automatic redirect to `/dashboard?view=feed`
6. LegacyFunctionalityPreserver handles URL cleanup

### For Non-Connected Users:
1. User visits legacy page
2. Enhanced migration notice is displayed
3. User can choose to:
   - Connect wallet and be redirected
   - View detailed migration guide
   - Continue using legacy page (with notice)
4. Migration preferences are saved to prevent repeated notices

## Data Preservation
