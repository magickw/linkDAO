## Technical Implementation

### Payment Method Detection (CheckoutFlow.tsx:196-287)

```typescript
// Adds all available payment methods
const methods = [
  // Crypto options (6 networks)
  { type: 'USDC', networks: [...] },
  { type: 'ETH', networks: [...] },
  { type: 'x402', networks: [...] },

  // Fiat option - ALWAYS AVAILABLE
  {
    id: 'stripe-fiat',
    type: PaymentMethodType.FIAT_STRIPE,
    name: 'Credit/Debit Card',
    description: 'No crypto wallet needed',
    enabled: true,
    supportedNetworks: [all networks]
  }
];
```

### Smart Routing (CheckoutFlow.tsx:646-676)

```typescript
// Determines which payment UI to show
if (selectedPaymentMethod.type === FIAT_STRIPE) {
  // Show Stripe checkout
  return <FiatPaymentDetails />;
} else {
  // Show crypto payment
  return <CryptoPaymentDetails />;
}
```

### Stripe Integration (CheckoutFlow.tsx:989-1016)

```typescript
<StripeCheckout
  amount={totalCost}
  currency="USD"
  orderId={orderId}
  onSuccess={(paymentIntentId) => {
    // Payment successful
    onProceed(); // Complete checkout
  }}
/>
```

  name: 'Credit/Debit Card',
  // ...

```

To prioritize fiat over crypto:
