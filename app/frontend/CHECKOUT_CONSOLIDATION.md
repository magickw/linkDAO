# Checkout Route Consolidation

## Summary
Consolidated checkout routes to use `/marketplace/checkout` as the single primary checkout page, removing the duplicate `/checkout` page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Duplicate Page
- **Deleted**: `src/pages/checkout.tsx`
  - This was a simpler implementation using `EnhancedCheckoutFlow`
  - Functionality is preserved in `/marketplace/checkout` which uses the more advanced `CheckoutFlow` component

### 2. Updated Route References
- **Updated**: `src/pages/marketplace/listing/[id].tsx`
  - Changed `handleBuyNow` redirect from `/checkout` to `/marketplace/checkout`
  - Line 200: `router.push('/marketplace/checkout?product=${productId}&quantity=${quantity}')`

### 3. Verified Existing Routes
The following pages already correctly route to `/marketplace/checkout`:
- ✅ `src/pages/marketplace/cart.tsx` (line 54)
- ✅ `src/pages/cart.tsx` (line 89)

## Architecture Decision

**Primary Checkout**: `/marketplace/checkout`
- Uses `CheckoutFlow` component with intelligent payment prioritization
- Supports multiple networks (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, etc.)
- Advanced features:
  - Real-time payment method cost comparison
  - Multi-network support with automatic gas fee calculation
  - User preference tracking
  - Smart payment method recommendations
  - Session persistence with localStorage

**Removed**: `/checkout`
- Was using simpler `EnhancedCheckoutFlow` component
- Had incomplete API integration (mock responses)
- Created routing confusion

## Components Still Available

The following components remain available for reuse:
- `EnhancedCheckoutFlow` - Used in `PurchaseModal` and other components
- `MobileCheckoutFlow` - Mobile-optimized checkout (needs implementation completion)
- `CheckoutFlow` - Primary checkout implementation at `/marketplace/checkout`

## Benefits of Consolidation

1. **Single Source of Truth**: One checkout route eliminates confusion
2. **Better Features**: `/marketplace/checkout` has more advanced payment prioritization
3. **Consistent UX**: All cart flows now lead to the same checkout experience
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Single implementation to test and update
5. **Clear Architecture**: Marketplace-specific routes under `/marketplace/*`

## Next Steps

To complete the checkout implementation:

1. **Complete Mobile Flow**: Implement step components in `MobileCheckoutFlow`
2. **Backend Integration**: Replace mock responses in `EnhancedCheckoutFlow` with real API calls
3. **Add Tests**: Implement test coverage for checkout flows (target: ≥80%)
4. **Session Timeout**: Add user warnings before 30-minute session expiration
5. **Error Recovery**: Add retry logic for failed payments
6. **Analytics**: Complete payment method selection tracking

## Testing Required

After these changes, test:
- [ ] Cart → Checkout flow from `/marketplace/cart`
- [ ] Cart → Checkout flow from `/cart`
- [ ] Buy Now → Checkout flow from product listing pages
- [ ] Session persistence across page refreshes
- [ ] Payment method selection and prioritization
- [ ] Multi-network checkout flows
