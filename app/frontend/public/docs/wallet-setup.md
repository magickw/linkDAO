# Wallet Setup Guide

Setting up a Web3 wallet is the first step to accessing LinkDAO and the broader Ethereum ecosystem. This guide will walk you through setting up MetaMask, the most popular browser extension wallet.

## What is a Web3 Wallet?

A Web3 wallet is a digital wallet that allows you to interact with blockchain networks like Ethereum. Unlike traditional wallets that store physical currency, Web3 wallets store cryptographic keys that allow you to access and manage your digital assets.

Key features of Web3 wallets:
- Store private keys that control your assets
- Sign transactions to send/receive tokens
- Interact with decentralized applications (dApps)
- Manage multiple blockchain networks
- Store NFTs and other digital collectibles
