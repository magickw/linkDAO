# LDAO Token Security Guide

Protect your LDAO tokens and account with these essential security practices.

## üõ°Ô∏è Wallet Security Fundamentals

Your seed phrase is the master key to your wallet. If someone gets it, they control your funds.

**‚úÖ DO**:
- Write seed phrase on paper (never digital)
- Store in multiple secure locations (safe, bank deposit box)
- Use metal backup plates for fire/water protection
- Test recovery process with small amounts first
- Keep copies in different geographic locations

**‚ùå NEVER**:
- Store seed phrase digitally (photos, cloud, email)
- Share with anyone (support will never ask)
- Enter on suspicious websites
- Store in password managers connected to internet
- Take photos or screenshots

### Hardware Wallet Recommendations
For amounts over $1,000, consider hardware wallets:

**Recommended Devices**:
- **Ledger Nano S Plus**: $79, supports 5,500+ coins
- **Ledger Nano X**: $149, Bluetooth, mobile support
- **Trezor Model One**: $69, open source, basic features

**2FA Setup Steps**:
1. Go to Account Settings ‚Üí Security

3. Scan QR code with authenticator app
4. Save backup codes securely
5. Test login with 2FA enabled
