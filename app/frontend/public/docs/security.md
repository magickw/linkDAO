# Security Framework

## Overview

LinkDAO implements a comprehensive security framework to protect user assets, data, and platform integrity. Security is our top priority.

## Smart Contract Security

### Audits

All LinkDAO smart contracts undergo rigorous security audits:

- ✅ **External Audits** - Conducted by leading blockchain security firms
- ✅ **Internal Reviews** - Continuous code reviews by our security team
- ✅ **Bug Bounty Program** - Rewards for responsible disclosure

### Best Practices

- **Multi-signature Wallets** - Critical operations require multiple approvals
- **Time Locks** - Delayed execution for sensitive operations
- **Upgrade Mechanisms** - Secure contract upgrade procedures
- **Access Controls** - Role-based permissions

## User Security

### Wallet Security

**Best Practices:**
1. Never share your seed phrase
2. Use hardware wallets for large amounts
3. Verify contract addresses before transactions
4. Enable two-factor authentication where available

### Transaction Safety

- **Transaction Simulation** - Preview transactions before signing
- **Address Verification** - Always verify recipient addresses
- **Gas Estimation** - Accurate gas estimates to prevent failures

## Data Security

### Encryption

- **End-to-End Encryption** - Sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** - Privacy-preserving verification
- **Secure Key Management** - Industry-standard key storage

### Privacy

- **Data Minimization** - Collect only necessary data
- **User Control** - Users control their data
- **GDPR Compliance** - Full compliance with privacy regulations

## Platform Security

### Infrastructure

- **DDoS Protection** - Advanced mitigation strategies
- **Rate Limiting** - Prevent abuse and attacks
- **Monitoring** - 24/7 security monitoring
- **Incident Response** - Rapid response team

### API Security

- **Authentication** - JWT-based authentication
- **Authorization** - Role-based access control
