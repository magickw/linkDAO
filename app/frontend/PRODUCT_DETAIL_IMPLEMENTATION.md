# Product Detail Page Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the product detail page in the LinkDAO marketplace.

## Components

### 1. Product Detail Page Component
- **Location**: `src/components/Marketplace/ProductDisplay/ProductDetailPage.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Reusable component that displays detailed information about a product
- **Features**:
  - Product images with gallery view
  - Pricing information (crypto and fiat)
  - Seller information with reputation metrics
  - Trust indicators (verified, escrow protected, DAO approved)
  - Product specifications
  - Reviews and ratings
  - Action buttons (Buy Now, Add to Cart, Wishlist, Contact Seller)
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### 2. Product Detail Page Route
- **Location**: `src/pages/marketplace/listing/[productId].tsx`
- **Purpose**: Next.js dynamic route that fetches product data and renders the ProductDetailPage component
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic routing based on product ID
  - Data fetching from marketplace service
  - Loading and error states
  - Fallback chain: marketplace service → mock API → static mock data
  - Integration with Layout component for consistent styling

## Data Flow

### Data Sources
1. **Primary**: Marketplace service (`marketplaceService.getListingByIdWithRetry`)
2. **Secondary**: Mock API endpoint (`/api/products/[productId]`)
3. **Fallback**: Static mock data (`src/data/mockProducts.ts`)

### Data Transformation
The product data from the marketplace service is transformed to match the interface expected by the ProductDetailPage component:
- Price formatting (crypto and fiat)
- Seller information mapping
- Trust indicators mapping
- Specifications mapping
- Media gallery creation

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Located in `src/components/Marketplace/ProductDisplay/__tests__/ProductDetailPage.test.tsx`
- Tests component rendering and user interactions
- Mocks design system components for isolated testing

### Integration Tests
- Located in `src/components/Marketplace/ProductDisplay/__tests__/ProductDetailPage.integration.test.tsx`
- Tests data fetching and error handling
- Mocks router and marketplace service

### Manual Testing
- Test page available at `/test/product-detail`
- Allows testing with mock data without backend dependency

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Responsive Design
- Mobile-optimized layout with touch-friendly controls
- Desktop-optimized layout with expanded information panels
- Flexible grid system for product images

### 2. Web3 Integration
- Ethereum-based pricing display
- Wallet address formatting for sellers
- Trust indicators for blockchain-verified products

### 3. User Experience
- Loading states with skeleton screens
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Quantity selector with inventory validation
- Image gallery with thumbnail navigation
- Action feedback through alerts

### 4. Performance
- Lazy loading for images
- Memoized data transformations
- Efficient re-rendering with React state management

## URLs for Testing

1. **Product Detail Page**: http://localhost:3003/marketplace/listing/1
2. **Manual Test Page**: http://localhost:3003/test/product-detail

## Mock Data

Mock product data is available in `src/data/mockProducts.ts` for testing without backend connectivity:
- Premium Wireless Headphones (ID: 1)
- Smart Fitness Watch (ID: 2)

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling with multiple fallback mechanisms:
- Loading states while fetching data
- Error states when data fetching fails
- Fallback to mock API endpoint when backend service is unavailable
- Final fallback to static mock data when all other methods fail
- User-friendly error messages and retry options

## Future Improvements

1. **3D/AR Viewing**: Implement actual 3D model viewers
2. **Related Products**: Add section for similar products
3. **Product Reviews**: Implement full review system with user comments
4. **Social Features**: Add sharing and social proof elements
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Enhance specification display with filtering options
