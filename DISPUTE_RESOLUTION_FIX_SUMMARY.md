# Dispute Resolution Component Fix Summary

## Issue
The frontend build was failing with a TypeScript error in the MobileDisputeResolution.tsx component:
```
Type error: This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types '"resolved" | "open" | "investigating" | "awaiting_response" | "closed"' and '"escalated"' have no overlap.
```

## Root Cause
1. The component was trying to filter disputes by 'escalated' status
2. However, 'escalated' is not a valid status value in the DisputeCase type definition
3. The component was also using properties that don't exist on the DisputeCase type:
   - `title` (should be `description`)
   - `buyer` and `seller` (should be `buyerId` and `sellerId`)
   - `messageCount` (doesn't exist)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Invalid 'escalated' Filter
Removed the 'escalated' filter from the filters array since it's not a valid dispute status:
```typescript
const filters = [
  { id: 'open', label: 'Open', count: disputes.filter(d => d.status === 'open').length },
  { id: 'investigating', label: 'Investigating', count: disputes.filter(d => d.status === 'investigating').length },
  { id: 'resolved', label: 'Resolved', count: disputes.filter(d => d.status === 'resolved').length }
];
```

### 2. Updated getStatusColor Function
Removed the 'escalated' case from the getStatusColor function:
```typescript
const getStatusColor = (status: string) => {
  switch (status) {
    case 'open': return 'bg-red-100 text-red-800';
    case 'investigating': return 'bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800';
    case 'resolved': return 'bg-green-100 text-green-800';
    default: return 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-800';
  }
};
```

### 3. Fixed Property References
Updated the component to use correct properties from the DisputeCase type:
- Changed `dispute.title` to `dispute.description || \`Dispute #${dispute.id}\``
- Changed `dispute.buyer` to `dispute.buyerId`
- Changed `dispute.seller` to `dispute.sellerId`
- Removed `dispute.messageCount` references and replaced with static text

## Expected Result
These changes should resolve the TypeScript compilation error and allow the frontend to build successfully. The component will now:
1. Only filter by valid dispute statuses
2. Use correct properties from the DisputeCase type
3. Display appropriate fallback text when description is not available
4. Maintain the same UI functionality with corrected data references

## Backend Context
Note that the backend does have an 'escalated' equivalent status called 'dao_escalation' in its DisputeStatus enum, but the frontend type definition uses a simplified status model. If full status synchronization is needed, the frontend type definition would need to be updated to match the backend enum.
