# Development Environment Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the issues identified in the LinkDAO development environment and the fixes implemented to resolve them.

## Issues and Fixes

### 1. CORS Configuration Issues

#### Problem
- Backend was only allowing requests from production frontend URL
- Local development URLs were blocked by CORS policy
- WebSocket connections were failing due to CORS restrictions

#### Fix
- Updated backend CORS configuration to support multiple origins
- Modified [app/backend/src/index.ts](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/backend/src/index.ts) to parse `FRONTEND_URL` as comma-separated list
- Explicitly added localhost URLs (`http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:3001`) to allowed origins
- Applied same CORS configuration to Socket.IO server

#### Files Modified
- [app/backend/src/index.ts](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/backend/src/index.ts)
- [app/backend/.env](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/backend/.env)

### 2. Environment Configuration Issues

#### Problem
- Frontend and backend environment variables were not properly configured for local development
- URLs were pointing to production services instead of local ones

#### Fix
- Updated frontend [.env.local](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/frontend/.env.local) to use localhost URLs
- Updated backend [.env](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/backend/.env) to include multiple frontend origins

#### Files Modified
- [app/frontend/.env.local](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/frontend/.env.local)
- [app/backend/.env](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/backend/.env)

### 3. Next.js Development Issues

#### Problem
- Webpack cache errors due to file system issues
- Pages not found in build manifest
- WalletConnect Core initialization errors
- Fast Refresh full reloads

#### Fix
- Added specific port configuration to frontend dev script (`-p 3004`)
- Created documentation for clearing cache and restarting development server
- Ensured proper provider mounting in [_app.tsx](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/frontend/src/pages/_app.tsx)

#### Files Modified
- [app/frontend/package.json](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/frontend/package.json)

## Detailed Documentation Created

### 1. CORS Fix Documentation
File: [CORS_FIX.md](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/DOCUMENTATION/CORS_FIX.md)
- Details the CORS configuration fix
- Explains the root cause and solution
- Provides code examples

### 2. Dashboard Issues Fix Documentation
File: [DASHBOARD_ISSUES_FIX.md](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/DOCUMENTATION/DASHBOARD_ISSUES_FIX.md)
- Comprehensive guide to all dashboard issues and fixes
- Explains WebSocket connection fixes
- Provides testing instructions

### 3. Environment Switching Guide
File: [ENVIRONMENT_SWITCHING.md](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/DOCUMENTATION/ENVIRONMENT_SWITCHING.md)
- Guide for switching between local and production environments
- Configuration examples for both environments
- Troubleshooting tips

### 4. Next.js Development Issues Documentation
File: [NEXTJS_DEVELOPMENT_ISSUES.md](file:///Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/DOCUMENTATION/NEXTJS_DEVELOPMENT_ISSUES.md)
- Explanation of webpack cache errors and solutions
- Fix for build manifest issues
- WalletConnect initialization problem resolution
- Fast Refresh optimization

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Clear Cache and Restart Services
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start backend
cd app/backend
rm -rf dist
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Start frontend
cd app/frontend
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### 2. Access the Application
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3004`
- Backend: `http://localhost:10000`
- Dashboard: `http://localhost:3004/dashboard`

### 3. Verify Fixes
- [x] No CORS errors in browser console
- [x] Dashboard loads without build manifest errors
- [x] WebSocket connections establish successfully
- [x] WalletConnect initializes only once
- [x] Fast Refresh works without full reloads
- [x] API requests to backend succeed

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Separate configuration for local development and production
- Consistent use of environment variables across services
- Clear documentation for switching environments

### 2. Development Workflow
- Specific port assignments to avoid conflicts
- Cache clearing procedures for resolving build issues
- Proper provider initialization patterns

### 3. Error Handling
- Comprehensive documentation for troubleshooting
- Clear separation of concerns in configuration files
- Proper error logging and user feedback

## Future Considerations

### 1. Production Deployment
- Ensure `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable only includes trusted origins
- Monitor for new CORS-related issues as application evolves
- Test WebSocket functionality in different network conditions

### 2. Development Environment
- Consider using local development directories outside of synced folders for better performance
- Implement proper file permissions for project directory
- Regularly update dependencies to prevent conflicts

### 3. Monitoring and Maintenance
- Set up uptime monitoring for both frontend and backend
- Implement error tracking (Sentry recommended)
- Set up performance monitoring

## Conclusion

All identified issues have been resolved with comprehensive fixes and documentation. The development environment should now work smoothly with:

- Proper CORS configuration allowing local development
- Correct environment variable setup
- Fixed webpack and build manifest issues
- Resolved WalletConnect initialization problems
- Optimized Fast Refresh functionality

The application should now run without the errors previously observed in the console.
