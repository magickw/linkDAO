## Backend API Endpoints:

### Push Notifications:
- `POST /api/mobile/push/register` - Register device token
- `DELETE /api/mobile/push/unregister` - Unregister device token
- `POST /api/mobile/push/preferences` - Update notification preferences

### Offline Browsing:
- `GET /api/mobile/offline/content` - Get cached content
- `POST /api/mobile/offline/sync` - Sync offline actions
- `GET /api/mobile/offline/status` - Get offline sync status

### Mobile Governance:
- `POST /api/mobile/governance/vote` - Mobile-optimized voting
- `POST /api/mobile/governance/proposal` - Create proposal with mobile workflow
- `GET /api/mobile/governance/analytics` - Mobile governance analytics

## Database Schema Changes:

### New Tables:
- `mobile_device_tokens` - Store device tokens for push notifications
- `offline_content_cache` - Cache content for offline browsing
- `offline_action_queue` - Queue for offline actions to sync
- `mobile_governance_sessions` - Track mobile governance activities

## Dependencies Added:

### Mobile App:
- `expo-notifications` - For push notification handling
- `expo-camera` - For camera integration
- `expo-file-system` - For offline storage
- `react-native-gesture-handler` - For gesture controls
