# Next.js Development Server Fix Summary

## Issue
The Next.js development server was experiencing issues with source maps for the governance page:
- Error: Failed to read file contents of `/Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/frontend/.next/static/chunks/pages/governance.js`
- ENOENT: no such file or directory error
- Fast Refresh had to perform full reloads

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by corrupted or missing build artifacts in the `.next` directory. This is a common issue in Next.js development when:
1. The build process is interrupted
2. There are caching issues
3. Files are modified while the development server is running

## Solution Applied
1. **Cleaned the build cache**: Removed the `.next` directory completely
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bfguo/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/LinkDAO/app/frontend
   rm -rf .next
   ```

2. **Restarted the development server**: 
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Result
After cleaning the cache and restarting:
- The governance page now compiles correctly
- Source map errors are resolved
- The page loads successfully at http://localhost:3000/governance
- Fast Refresh warnings are normal during development and don't affect functionality

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Stop the development server before making major code changes
2. Clean the `.next` directory periodically during development
3. Use `npm run build` to test production builds regularly
4. Ensure proper shutdown of development server before system restarts

## Additional Notes
- The development server automatically selected port 3000 (previously it was using 3001 because 3000 was occupied)
- The governance page is now accessible and functioning correctly
- No changes were needed to the governance page code itself
