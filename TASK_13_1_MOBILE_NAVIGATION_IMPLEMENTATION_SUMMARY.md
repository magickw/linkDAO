- **Touch interaction testing** with gesture simulation
- **Responsive behavior testing** across breakpoints

### Test Files Created
1. `MobileNavigation.test.tsx` - Navigation component tests
2. `FilterDrawer.test.tsx` - Filter drawer functionality tests
3. `SwipeableProductCards.test.tsx` - Card swipe interaction tests
4. `BiometricAuth.test.tsx` - Authentication flow tests
5. `ResponsiveGrid.test.tsx` - Grid layout and responsiveness tests
6. `MobileResponsiveIntegration.test.tsx` - Integration tests
