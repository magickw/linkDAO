  itemType: "NFT",
  listingType: "AUCTION",
  duration: 86400, // 24 hours
  metadataURI: "ipfs://...",
  nftStandard: "ERC721",
  tokenId: "123",
  reservePrice: "2000000000000000000", // 2 ETH reserve
  minIncrement: "100000000000000000" // 0.1 ETH minimum increment
};

fetch('/api/marketplace/listings', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(auctionListing)
});
```

### Submitting Dispute Evidence
```javascript
const disputeEvidence = {
  userAddress: "0x...",
  evidence: [
    "ipfs://evidence1",
    "ipfs://evidence2"
  ]
};

fetch('/api/marketplace/disputes/123/evidence', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(disputeEvidence)
});
```

### Checking AI Moderation Status
```javascript
// Check moderation status for a listing
fetch('/api/marketplace/ai-moderation/listing/456')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```
