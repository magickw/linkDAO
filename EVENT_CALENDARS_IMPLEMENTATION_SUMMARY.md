# Event and Activity Calendars Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of Event and Activity Calendars features for the LinkDAO platform, specifically addressing the "Event and Activity Calendars" requirements from the COMMUNITIES_FUNCTIONALITY_ASSESSMENT.md document.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Community Event Scheduling
- **Event Creation**: Communities can create and schedule events with detailed information
- **Event Types**: Support for different event types (meetings, AMAs, workshops, competitions, etc.)
- **Recurring Events**: Support for recurring event patterns
- **Location Tracking**: Both physical and virtual event locations
- **Capacity Management**: Maximum attendee limits for events
- **Metadata Storage**: Flexible storage for additional event information

### 2. RSVP System
- **Event Registration**: Users can RSVP to events with different status levels (confirmed, maybe, declined)
- **Attendee Tracking**: Track number of attendees per event
- **RSVP Deadlines**: Set deadlines for event registration
- **Group RSVPs**: Support for multiple attendees per RSVP

### 3. Event Discovery
- **Community Events**: View upcoming events within a specific community
- **Cross-Community Events**: Discover events across all communities a user is part of
- **User Events**: View events a user has RSVP'd to
- **Future Event Filtering**: Only show upcoming events

### 4. Event Management
- **Event Details**: Comprehensive event information display
- **Attendee Counts**: Real-time attendee tracking
- **Event Updates**: Modify event details as needed

## Database Schema Changes

### Tables Created/Enhanced

1. **community_events**
   - Manages community event scheduling
   - Columns: id, community_id, title, description, event_type, start_time, end_time, location, is_recurring, recurrence_pattern, max_attendees, rsvp_required, rsvp_deadline, metadata, created_at, updated_at

2. **event_rsvps**
   - Tracks event registrations
   - Columns: id, event_id, user_id, status, attendees_count, metadata, created_at, updated_at

## Backend Implementation

### Services Enhanced

1. **RecommendationService** (`/app/backend/src/services/recommendationService.ts`)
   - Added event management methods
   - Implemented RSVP system
   - Created event discovery features
   - Added cross-community event discovery

### Key Methods Implemented

1. **createCommunityEvent()**
   - Creates new community events
   - Handles all event metadata
   - Returns complete event information with attendee counts

2. **getCommunityEvents()**
   - Retrieves upcoming events for a specific community
   - Filters out past events
   - Includes attendee counts

3. **getCrossCommunityEvents()**
   - Discovers events across all communities a user belongs to
   - Provides broad event discovery capabilities

4. **getUserUpcomingEvents()**
   - Shows events a user has RSVP'd to
   - Helps users track their event commitments

5. **createEventRsvp()**
   - Manages event registrations
   - Supports different RSVP statuses
   - Handles group RSVPs

6. **getEventDetails()**
   - Provides comprehensive event information
   - Includes RSVP information when needed

## API Endpoints

The implementation provides a foundation for the following API endpoints:

1. `POST /api/events` - Create new community events
2. `GET /api/events/community/:communityId` - Get events for a specific community
3. `GET /api/events/user/:userId` - Get events for a specific user
4. `GET /api/events/cross-community/:userId` - Get events across user's communities
5. `POST /api/events/rsvp` - Create or update event RSVP
6. `GET /api/events/:eventId` - Get detailed event information

## Frontend Integration Opportunities

The backend implementation provides all necessary functionality for frontend features:

1. **Event Creation Interface**
   - Form for creating new events
   - Date/time pickers
   - Location input
   - Recurrence options

2. **Event Calendar View**
   - Monthly/weekly/day views
   - Color-coded events by community
   - RSVP status indicators

3. **Event Discovery Pages**
   - Community-specific event listings
   - Cross-community event discovery
   - Personal event dashboard

4. **RSVP Management**
   - Simple RSVP buttons
   - Status selection (Going, Maybe, Not Going)
   - Group RSVP capabilities

## Technical Features

### 1. Data Integrity
- Proper foreign key relationships between events, communities, and users
- Unique constraints for RSVPs (one per user-event combination)
- Proper indexing for performance

### 2. Flexibility
- Support for various event types
- Extensible metadata system
- Configurable RSVP requirements

### 3. Scalability
- Efficient database queries
- Proper indexing strategies
- Support for large numbers of events and attendees

## Future Enhancements

1. **Notification System**
   - Email/SMS reminders for upcoming events
   - RSVP confirmation notifications
   - Event update alerts

2. **Calendar Integration**
   - Export events to Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.
   - iCal feed support
   - Calendar synchronization

3. **Advanced Scheduling**
   - Conflict detection
   - Availability polling
   - Automatic scheduling suggestions

4. **Event Analytics**
   - Attendance tracking
   - Engagement metrics
   - Community participation reports

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Database schema validation
- CRUD operations for events
- RSVP management testing
- Cross-community discovery validation
- Edge case handling for event dates and capacities

## Deployment

To deploy these features:
1. Run the database migration (`0047_ai_recommendations.sql` already includes event tables)
2. Deploy updated backend services
3. Implement frontend interfaces
4. Test all event lifecycle operations
5. Monitor performance and adjust as needed
