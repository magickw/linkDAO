# Development Guidelines

This document outlines the development guidelines and best practices for contributing to the LinkDAO project.

## Code Style and Standards

### General Principles
- Follow the existing code style in each workspace
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic and business rules
- Write unit tests for new functionality

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict type checking
- Use ESLint with the project's configuration
- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript style guide with project-specific modifications

### Solidity
- Follow the Solidity style guide
- Use explicit function visibility specifiers
- Use modifiers for common checks
- Implement proper error handling with custom errors
- Use events for state changes that clients need to know about

## Git Workflow

### Branching Strategy
- Use feature branches for all new development
- Branch names should be descriptive (e.g., `feature/user-profiles`, `fix/login-bug`)
- Keep branches small and focused on a single feature or bug fix

### Commit Messages
- Use conventional commit messages
- Start with a capital letter
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Provide detailed explanation in the body when necessary

Example:
```
feat(profile): add user profile creation functionality

- Implement profile creation form
- Add validation for required fields
- Integrate with smart contract
```

### Pull Requests
- Create pull requests for all changes
- Ensure all tests pass before requesting review
- Keep pull requests small and focused
- Provide a clear description of the changes
- Link to related issues when applicable
- Request review from relevant team members

## Testing

### Test Structure
- Organize tests to mirror the source code structure
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Test both positive and negative cases
- Mock external dependencies where appropriate

### Test Coverage
- Aim for >80% test coverage for new code
- Focus on testing business logic rather than implementation details
- Use integration tests for critical user flows
- Write end-to-end tests for core functionality

### Testing Tools
- Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript unit tests
- Hardhat for Solidity contract testing
- Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end tests

## Security

### Smart Contracts
- Follow the Ethereum Smart Contract Security Best Practices
- Get external audits for critical contracts
- Use established libraries (OpenZeppelin) when possible
- Implement proper access control
- Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
- Validate all inputs

### Web Applications
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Sanitize user inputs
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement Content Security Policy
- Protect against CSRF and XSS attacks

### API Security
- Use rate limiting
- Implement proper authentication (JWT, OAuth)
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Performance

### Frontend
- Optimize bundle size
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources
- Use efficient rendering techniques
- Optimize images and other assets
- Implement proper caching strategies

### Backend
- Use database indexing for frequently queried fields
- Implement caching for expensive operations
- Use connection pooling for database connections
- Optimize API response times
- Implement pagination for large datasets

### Smart Contracts
- Minimize gas consumption
- Avoid unnecessary storage operations
- Use efficient data structures
- Implement batch operations where possible

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Document all public functions and classes
- Use JSDoc/TSDoc for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use NatSpec for Solidity contracts
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

### API Documentation
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger for REST APIs
- Document all endpoints, parameters, and responses
- Provide example requests and responses
- Keep documentation synchronized with API changes

### User Documentation
- Write clear and concise user guides
- Include screenshots and examples where helpful
- Keep documentation updated with new features
- Provide troubleshooting guides for common issues

## Deployment

### Continuous Integration
- All code must pass CI checks before merging
- CI should run all tests and linting checks
- Use automated code quality checks
- Implement security scanning in CI pipeline

### Continuous Deployment
- Use blue-green or canary deployment strategies
- Implement proper rollback procedures
- Monitor deployments for errors
- Use feature flags for risky changes

### Environment Management
- Use separate environments for development, staging, and production
- Manage environment-specific configuration properly
- Never commit sensitive information to the repository
- Use secret management solutions for credentials

## Monitoring and Logging

### Application Monitoring
- Implement application performance monitoring
- Set up alerts for critical metrics
- Monitor error rates and response times
- Track business metrics relevant to the application

### Logging
- Use structured logging
- Include relevant context in log messages
- Set appropriate log levels
- Implement log aggregation for analysis

## Accessibility

### Web Applications
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- Ensure proper semantic HTML
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Provide alternative text for images
- Use sufficient color contrast

## Internationalization

### Localization
- Design UI to accommodate different text lengths
- Use proper date, time, and number formatting
- Support right-to-left languages when needed
- Externalize all user-facing strings

## Mobile Considerations

### Performance
- Optimize for mobile network conditions
- Minimize battery usage
- Implement offline functionality where appropriate
- Optimize touch interactions

### Platform Guidelines
- Follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines
- Follow Material Design guidelines for Android
- Implement proper navigation patterns
- Handle device orientation changes

## Review Process

### Code Review
- All code must be reviewed by at least one other developer
- Reviewers should check for correctness, security, and maintainability
- Provide constructive feedback
- Ensure tests are adequate

### Security Review
- Critical security changes must be reviewed by security team
- Implement threat modeling for new features
- Regular security audits of the codebase

By following these guidelines, we can ensure a consistent, secure, and maintainable codebase that delivers value to our users.
