### Wallet & Payments
- Built-in smart accounts (ERC-4337 account abstraction)
- Multi-asset support (USDC, USDT, native tokens)
- Payment methods (direct transfers, QR codes, payment links)
- Gas abstraction with sponsored transactions

### Governance
- Community creation with customizable roles
- Proposal system with off-chain voting
- Treasury management with multisig support
- Delegation and reputation-weighted voting

### Security & Trust
