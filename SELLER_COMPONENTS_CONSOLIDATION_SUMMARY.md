# Seller Components Consolidation Summary

## Overview
Successfully consolidated the seller components by moving them from the standalone `app/frontend/src/components/Seller/` folder into the existing marketplace structure at `app/frontend/src/components/Marketplace/Seller/`. This eliminates redundancy and creates a more organized component hierarchy.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Component Migration**
- **From**: `app/frontend/src/components/Seller/`
- **To**: `app/frontend/src/components/Marketplace/Seller/`

#### Moved Components:
- `SellerOnboarding.tsx` → `app/frontend/src/components/Marketplace/Seller/SellerOnboarding.tsx`
- `onboarding/WalletConnectStep.tsx` → `app/frontend/src/components/Marketplace/Seller/onboarding/WalletConnectStep.tsx`
- `onboarding/ProfileSetupStep.tsx` → `app/frontend/src/components/Marketplace/Seller/onboarding/ProfileSetupStep.tsx`
- `onboarding/VerificationStep.tsx` → `app/frontend/src/components/Marketplace/Seller/onboarding/VerificationStep.tsx`
- `onboarding/PayoutSetupStep.tsx` → `app/frontend/src/components/Marketplace/Seller/onboarding/PayoutSetupStep.tsx`
- `onboarding/FirstListingStep.tsx` → `app/frontend/src/components/Marketplace/Seller/onboarding/FirstListingStep.tsx`

### 2. **Enhanced SellerDashboard**
- **Consolidated**: `app/frontend/src/components/Marketplace/Dashboard/SellerDashboard.tsx`
- **Merged features** from both the old basic dashboard and the new advanced dashboard
- **Added glassmorphism design** system integration
- **Enhanced functionality** including:
  - Seller tier management and upgrade prompts
  - Real-time notifications system
  - Advanced performance metrics
  - Seller profile integration
  - Modern UI with glassmorphic panels

### 3. **Import Path Updates**
- Updated all import paths to use the new marketplace structure
- Fixed design system imports to use the consolidated export
- Updated page components:
  - `app/frontend/src/pages/seller/onboarding.tsx`
  - `app/frontend/src/pages/seller/dashboard.tsx`

### 4. **TypeScript Fixes**
- Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
- Added proper type annotations for array methods
- Updated Button component size props from `"sm"` to `"small"`
- Fixed wagmi hook property names (`isLoading` → `isPending`)

### 5. **Component Structure**
```
