# Phase 2 Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Phase 2 focused on implementing core features: file uploads, WebSocket live chat, real-time notifications, and search integration.

---

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. File Upload System

#### Frontend Components
**Created Files:**
- `/services/ipfsUploadService.ts` - IPFS upload service with validation
- `/hooks/useFileUpload.ts` - File upload hook with progress tracking

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
const { uploading, uploadFile, uploadedFiles } = useFileUpload();

const handleUpload = async (file: File) => {
  const result = await uploadFile(file);
  // result.cid, result.url available
};
```

### 4. Search Integration

#### Frontend Components
**Created Files:**

- Category filtering
- Type filtering (FAQ, tickets, all)
- Query validation
- Result ranking

**API Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/support/search?q=wallet&type=faq&category=technical
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "faq": [...],
    "tickets": [...]
  },
  "query": "wallet"
}
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### WebSocket Architecture

**Connection Flow:**
1. User authenticates with JWT token
2. Frontend establishes WebSocket connection
3. Backend verifies token and creates session
4. Agent assigned after 2-second delay
5. Messages routed between user and agent
6. Connection tracked for cleanup

**Message Format:**
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  sessionId: string;
  sender: 'user' | 'agent';
  content: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### File Upload Flow

**Upload Process:**
1. File selected by user
2. Client-side validation (size, type)
3. File sent to API route via FormData
4. Server validates and uploads to IPFS
5. IPFS CID returned to client
6. CID stored with ticket/message

**Storage:**
- Files stored on IPFS
- CIDs stored in database
- Public gateway URLs generated
- Attachments array in tickets/responses

### Notification System

**Notification Flow:**
1. Backend event triggers notification
2. Notification sent via WebSocket
3. Frontend receives and stores
4. Browser notification shown (if permitted)
5. Unread count updated
6. User can mark as read

**Notification Types:**
- `ticket-update` - Status changes
- `ticket-response` - New responses
- `chat-message` - Chat messages
- `system` - System announcements

---

## Integration Points

### 1. Contact Form + File Upload
```typescript
const { uploadMultiple } = useFileUpload();
const { createTicket } = useSupportTickets();

const handleSubmit = async (files: File[]) => {
  const uploads = await uploadMultiple(files);
  const attachments = uploads.map(u => u.cid);
  
  await createTicket({
    subject,
    description,
    category,
    priority,
    attachments,
  });
};
```

### 2. Live Chat + Notifications
```typescript
// Notifications automatically include chat messages
// No additional integration needed
```

### 3. Search + FAQ Display
```typescript
const handleSearch = async (query: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/support/search?q=${query}&type=faq`);
  const data = await response.json();
  setResults(data.data.faq);
};
```

## Performance Metrics

### Target Metrics
- File upload: < 5s for 5MB file
- WebSocket latency: < 100ms

### Future Enhancements
1. **File Upload**:
   - Chunked uploads
   - Resume capability
   - Image compression
   - Virus scanning

2. **Live Chat**:
   - Multiple agent support
   - Queue management
   - Chat history persistence
   - File sharing in chat

3. **Notifications**:
   - Persistent storage
