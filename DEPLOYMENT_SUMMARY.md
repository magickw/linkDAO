# LinkDAO Deployment Summary

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive summary of how to deploy the complete LinkDAO platform, including both frontend and backend components.

## Architecture
The LinkDAO platform consists of:
1. **Frontend**: Next.js/React application (deployed to Vercel)
2. **Backend**: Node.js/Express API (deployed to Render or similar)
3. **Smart Contracts**: Solidity contracts (deployed to Base network)
4. **Database**: In-memory storage (can be upgraded to PostgreSQL/MongoDB)

## Deployment Components

### 1. Frontend (Vercel)
- **Repository Path**: `/app/frontend`
- **Build Command**: `next build`
- **Output Directory**: `.next`
- **Environment Variables Required**:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_RPC_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_GOERLI_RPC_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_ADDRESS`

### 2. Backend (Render/Node.js Hosting)
- **Repository Path**: `/app/backend`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Environment Variables Required**:
  - `JWT_SECRET`
  - `PORT`
  - `FRONTEND_URL`
  - `RPC_URL`
  - `PROFILE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS`
  - `FOLLOW_MODULE_ADDRESS`
  - `PAYMENT_ROUTER_ADDRESS`
  - `GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS`
  - `MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS`

### 3. Smart Contracts (Hardhat)
- **Repository Path**: `/app/contracts`
- **Network**: Base (mainnet or testnet)
- **Deployment Script**: `scripts/deploy.ts`

## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Smart Contract Deployment
1. Navigate to `/app/contracts`
2. Update network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`
3. Run deployment script: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network base`
4. Note the deployed contract addresses

### Phase 2: Backend Deployment
1. Choose a hosting provider (Render recommended)
2. Connect your repository
3. Set root directory to `/app/backend`
4. Configure environment variables with deployed contract addresses
5. Deploy the application

### Phase 3: Frontend Deployment
1. Navigate to Vercel dashboard
2. Import your repository
3. Set root directory to `/app/frontend`
4. Configure environment variables
5. Deploy the application

## Environment Variable Mapping

### Backend → Frontend
After deploying the backend, update the frontend environment variable:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com/api
```

### Contract Addresses
After deploying smart contracts, update these backend environment variables:
```
PROFILE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0x...
FOLLOW_MODULE_ADDRESS=0x...
PAYMENT_ROUTER_ADDRESS=0x...
GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS=0x...
MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS=0x...
```

## Deployment Scripts

### Frontend Deployment
Located at `/app/frontend/deploy.sh`
```bash
cd /app/frontend
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Frontend: `GET /health`
- Backend: `GET /health`

### Logs
- Vercel: Dashboard → Your Project → Logs
- Render: Dashboard → Your Service → Logs

### Updates
To update your deployment:
1. Push changes to your repository
2. Trigger a new deployment in your hosting provider
3. Monitor the deployment process
4. Verify functionality after deployment

## Scaling Considerations

### For High Traffic
1. **Frontend**: Vercel automatically scales
2. **Backend**: 
   - Upgrade to a paid hosting plan
   - Implement database instead of in-memory storage
   - Add Redis for caching
   - Use load balancing
3. **Database**: 
   - Migrate from in-memory to PostgreSQL/MongoDB
   - Add read replicas
   - Implement proper indexing

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use hosting provider's secret management
- Rotate secrets regularly

### Network Security
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Add rate limiting
- Use Web Application Firewall (WAF)

### Authentication
- Use strong JWT secrets
- Implement token expiration
- Consider refresh tokens

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CORS Errors**
   - Verify `FRONTEND_URL` matches deployed frontend URL
   - Check CORS configuration in backend

2. **Wallet Connection Issues**
   - Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`
   - Check network configuration

3. **API Connection Issues**
   - Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` points to correct backend
   - Check backend logs for errors

4. **Contract Interaction Issues**
   - Verify all contract addresses are correct
   - Check RPC endpoint availability
   - Verify network configuration

## Support and Maintenance

### Documentation
- [Vercel Deployment Guide](VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
- [Backend Deployment Guide](BACKEND_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
- [Technical Architecture](TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md)

### Monitoring
- Set up uptime monitoring for both frontend and backend
- Implement error tracking (Sentry recommended)
- Set up performance monitoring

### Updates
- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Test updates in staging environment before production

## Conclusion

The LinkDAO platform is now ready for deployment. The marketplace feature has been successfully implemented and integrated with the existing social and DeFi functionalities. 

By following the deployment guides and using the provided scripts, you can deploy the complete platform to production hosting providers. The modular architecture allows for independent scaling of components based on traffic and performance requirements.
