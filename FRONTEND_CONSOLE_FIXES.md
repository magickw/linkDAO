# Frontend Console Error Fixes - 2025-10-31

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Payment Icon (404 Errors)

**Problem:**
Hundreds of console errors:
```
GET https://www.linkdao.io/icons/payment-default.svg 404 (Not Found)
```

**Root Cause:**
- Payment method components were trying to load `/icons/payment-default.svg` as fallback
- The `/icons` directory didn't exist
- The icon file didn't exist

**Fix:**
- Created `/icons` directory in `app/frontend/public/`
- Created `payment-default.svg` with a generic payment icon design

**Files Created:**
- `app/frontend/public/icons/payment-default.svg`

### 2. Infinite Loop in Image Error Handlers

**Problem:**
When payment icons failed to load, the error handler would set `payment-default.svg` as fallback, which also didn't exist, triggering another error, creating an infinite loop.

**Root Cause:**
- Error handlers were unconditionally setting the same fallback image
- No check to prevent re-setting the same fallback

**Fix:**
- Added check: `if (!img.src.includes('payment-default.svg'))` before setting fallback
- Prevents infinite loop by only setting fallback once

**Files Modified:**
- `app/frontend/src/components/PaymentMethodPrioritization/PaymentMethodCard.tsx` (line 148-154)
- `app/frontend/src/components/PaymentMethodPrioritization/CostComparisonTable.tsx` (line 283-289)
- `app/frontend/src/components/PaymentMethodPrioritization/GasFeeWarning.tsx` (line 210-216)

## Backend Issues (Not Fixed in Frontend)

### 1. Backend Server Down (503 Errors)

**Issue:**
```
Access to fetch at 'https://linkdao-backend.onrender.com/api/*' from origin 'https://www.linkdao.io' has been blocked by CORS policy
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 503 ()
```

**Status:** ❌ **Backend Issue**
- Your backend service at `linkdao-backend.onrender.com` is down or crashed
- See `BACKEND_CRASH_FIXES.md` for the fix
- Backend needs to be redeployed with the crash fixes

### 2. CORS Configuration

**Issue:**
```
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource
```

**Status:** ✅ **Backend Config Issue**
- CORS is configured in `DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md` line 31
- Ensure Render environment variable is set:
  ```
  CORS_ORIGIN=https://www.linkdao.io,https://linkdao.io,https://linkdao.vercel.app
  ```

### 3. WebSocket Connection Failures

**Issue:**
```
WebSocket connection to 'wss://linkdao-backend.onrender.com/socket.io/' failed
```

**Status:** ❌ **Backend Down**
- Will resolve once backend is running again

### 4. API Rate Limiting

**Issue:**
```
Rate limit exceeded for: GET:https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price
Rate limit exceeded for: GET:https://ip-api.com/json/
```

**Status:** ⚠️ **External API Limits**
- These are external API rate limits (CoinGecko, IP geolocation)
- Consider:
  - Implementing response caching
  - Using paid API tiers
  - Reducing request frequency

## Testing

After deploying these fixes:

1. **No more 404 errors** for `/icons/payment-default.svg`
2. **No more infinite loops** in image loading
3. **Console should be much cleaner** (once backend is up)

Still Expected (until backend fixed):
- CORS errors (backend needs to be restarted)
- 503 errors (backend is down)
- WebSocket failures (backend is down)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Frontend icon fixes deployed
2. ⏳ Deploy backend crash fixes (see `BACKEND_CRASH_FIXES.md`)
3. ⏳ Restart Render backend service
4. ⏳ Verify CORS headers are present
5. ⏳ Test full frontend-backend connection
